It looks like we overlooked ([yesterday](http://datadrivensecurity.info/blog/posts/2014/Jan/dds-on-google-books/)) that Data-Driven Security (the book) is also [available as a Nook book](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/data-driven-security-jay-jacobs/1117239036) _now_ (not pre-order). 

And, to avoid another e-book shameless self-promotion post, it looks like you can also get it now for your [Kobo Reader](http://store.kobobooks.com/en-US/ebook/data-driven-security).

A huge "thank you" to everyone for their kind words (and purchases!) yesterday! We hope everyone enjoys our modest tome.
