I had the opportunity to attend [http://computefest.seas.harvard.edu/data-storm](Weathering the Data Storm: The Promise and Challenges of Data Science) at Harvard yesterday (2013-01-24). Overall, it was an excellent symposium and I'll be talking with Jay about it on the next [podcast](http://datadrivensecurity.info/podcast).

The [@DDSecBlog)[http://twitter.com/ddsecblog/] account was live-tweeting as much as possible and I've hoovered them all up and put them below. So, while you're waiting for the podcast you can peruse the tweets to see i there are 140 character nuggets worth bookmarking.
