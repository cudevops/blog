If your day happens to be too tumultuous for a textbook and too busy for a long-form blog post, consider tapping into these Twitter resources to see what's happening in the world of [security] data science:

- [`#rstats`](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) : While it may only take a few minutes to peruse the latest entries in this hashtag-enabled search for all-things "R", you will end up favoriting/bookmarking many great resources. It's an especially good way to see what new awesomeness [@hadleywickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) (and others) has contributed to one of our favorite tools/languages.
- [`#ipython`](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ipython) : Not to be left in the dust by the R folk, the IPython crowd also has a well-worn hashtag that will provide great pointers to tools, conferences, books and other resources to help you create `#spiffy` analyses and visualizations in Python.
- [@StatsBlogs](https://twitter.com/StatsBlogs) : If you prefer tweets over RSS feeds, then follow @StatsBlogs to catch up on the latest posts to that site, whicn aggregates "data science" blog posts. I've not found a day where there hasn't been a useful/informative nugget there.
- [@visualisingdata](https://twitter.com/visualisingdata) : Andy Kirk is one of the leading voices in modern visualization and posts excellent resources very regularly. Great place to get inspiration for how to tell a story with your data.
- [@eagereyes](https://twitter.com/eagereyes) : Robert Kosara offers commentary and insight on performing data analysis and communicating through visualizations. He also offers a point of view from the Tableau world for those who have not been bitten by the R or Python bug.
- [@secviz](https://twitter.com/secviz) : Twitter presence for the web site, offering a place to share, discuss, challenge, and learn about security visualization, big data, and security intelligence.
- [@analyticbridge](https://twitter.com/analyticbridge) : Nice collection of diverse data science-y news & information links.
- [@mbostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock) : If you want to do D3, you have to follow Bostock `#itsthelaw`
- [@hackingdata](https://twitter.com/hackingdata) : Twitter feed from one of the modern "co-founders" of the term "data scientist". Great resources you probably won't find in the other feeds.
- [@kdnuggets](https://twitter.com/kdnuggets) : There are days when I can't even keep up with the onslaught of links from Gregory Piatetsky.
