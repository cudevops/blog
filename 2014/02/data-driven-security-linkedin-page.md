With the launch of our new [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-driven-security), the Data Driven Security circle is now complete (well, at least until another social/professional network comes along). Not every reader (blog or [book](http://bit.ly/ddsec)) is on Twitter or Google+ and neither I nor Jay are Facebook users, so we wanted to make sure there was a place for the data-driven security community to hang out on LinkedIn as well.

We'll occassionally be posting some LinkedIn-only content on that page (not just blog re-posts) so give it a follow there and stay tuned for updates!
