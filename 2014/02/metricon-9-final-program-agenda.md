Jay & I had the privilege of co-coordinating Metricon 9 this year. It's co-located with RSA (USA, 2014) again this year and is on Friday (the 28th) in Room 132 from 0800-1700PST (officially starting at 0900).

You can download the [full agenda](http://datadrivensecurity.info/blog/extra/metricon9-agenda.pdf) or view it below (provided the `IFRAME` behaves) and follow the hashtag `#m9` this Friday for tweets from the event. We'll be posting full proceedings in the weeks following the conference.

I'd like to personally thank:

- [Risk I/O](https://www.risk.io/)
- [Tripwire](http://www.tripwire.com/)
- [CXOWare](http://www.cxoware.com/), and
- [RSA](http://www.rsaconference.com/)

for their generous support of this collaborative and engaging event.

The lineup of speakers and attendees is truly exceptional and it will be difficult walking away from the conference not having learned something new and met someone interesting.

If you are attending (*there's space left, so hit me up if you still want to go*), you may even win a copy of [a certain book](http://amzn.to/ddsec) :-)
