Shipping notices for the dead-tree version of the [book](http://amzn.to/ddsec) have started to trickle out, so we've removed the static landing page that we've had up for the book and launched an actual [book sub-site](http://dds.ec/book) where we'll be able to post errata and provide updates on sales, promotions, book signings and speaking engagements.

We'll try to keep "book stuff" separate from "blog stuff" unless there's something earth-shattering or highly informative we feel needs cross-posting.
