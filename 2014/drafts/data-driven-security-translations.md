(That glyph is "Celebration!")

Jay &amp; I just got word that [Data-Driven Security](http://amzn.to/ddsec) is being translated into Simplified Chinese for distribution throughout Asian markets. The licensee is Beijing Huazhang Graphics & Information Co., Ltd. and we'll actually be getting **print copies** of the translated text!

To the folks who found us in San Francisco at RSA 2014 or Metricon 9: *Thank you!* for your kind and encouraging words! It was great meeting you and we truly appreciate your exitement for the book.
