While Data-Driven Security (The Book) is still in pre-order on many retailers, you can sneak an **advance copy** of it by heading over to [Google Books](http://buff.ly/1fflgrj) or [Google Play](http://l.dds.ec/1ejniIM). Despite Google "knowing all", we can assure you that Jay is not <i>"a journalist and food critic."</i> Remember, the **official launch date** is February 17, 2014. 

Data Driven Security is _also_ now available on your [Amazon Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I1Y7THY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00I1Y7THY&linkCode=as2&tag=rudisdotnet-20).
