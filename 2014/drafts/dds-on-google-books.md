While Data-Driven Security (The Book) is still in pre-order on many retailers, you can sneak an **advance copy** of it by heading over to [Google Books](http://buff.ly/1fflgrj) or [Google Play](http://l.dds.ec/1ejniIM). Despite Google "knowing all", we can assure you that Jay is not <i>"a journalist and food critic."</i> Remember, the official launch date is February 17, 2014.
