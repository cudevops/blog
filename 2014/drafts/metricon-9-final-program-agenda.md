Jay & I had the privilege of co-coordinating Metricon 9 this year. It's co-located with RSA again this year and is on Friday (the 28th) in Room 132 from 0800-1700 (officially starting at 0900).

You can download the [full agenda](http://datadrivensecurity.info/blog/extra/metricon9-agenda.pdf) or view it below (provided the IFRAME behaves) and follow the hashtag `#metricon9` this Friday for tweets from the event. We'll be posting full proceedings in the weeks following the conference.

I'd like to personally thank:

- [Risk I/O]()
- [Tripwire]()
- [CXOWare](), and
- [RSA]()

for their generous support of this collaborative and engaging event. The lineup of speakers and attendees is exceptional and a good time will be had by all who attend.

If you are attending (there's space left, so hit me up if you still want to go), you may even win a copy of [a certain book](http://amzn.to/ddsec) :-)
