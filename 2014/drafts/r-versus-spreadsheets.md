One of the myriad of reasons we created the Data Driven Security blog was to provide pointers to data analysis and visualization resources for security domain experts who may have not been exposed to these types of tools. 

I'd venture a posit that most folks jump into some type of spreadsheet software whenever they get their hands on a manageable data set and start crunching from there. Spreadsheets are extremely convenient but they are definitely not the tool Jay or I look to when crunching through data sets (small or large).

Burns Statistics has a [great set of posts](http://www.burns-stat.com/tag/r-versus-spreadsheet/) on the use of R versus the use of spreadsheets, complete with examples of performing similar operations in both tools.

You should start with "[A First Step Towards R From Spreadsheets](http://www.burns-stat.com/first-step-towards-r-spreadsheets/)" then make your way to "[From Spreadsheet Thinking to R Thinking](http://www.burns-stat.com/spreadsheet-r-vector/)" and then bookmark/RSS the site and watch for future posts.
