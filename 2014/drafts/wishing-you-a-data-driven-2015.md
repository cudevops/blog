First we'd like to give a huge **thank you** to all our blog & book readers (and guest contributors) + podcast guests & listeners. You all made 2015 a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious year for Jay & I with your tweets, reviews, ideas, commentary, contributuons and in-person connections.

In twelve months, we managed to crank out 77 blog posts, record 14 podcasts and garner a few thousand book readers. Along the way, we've [challenged some iconic beliefs](http://datadrivensecurity.info/blog/posts/2014/Dec/ponemon/), [poked fun at some iconic industry idioms](http://datadrivensecurity.info/blog/posts/2014/Oct/roll-your-own-ip-attack-graphs/), [met some spiffy security data scientists](http://datadrivensecurity.info/podcast/) and even managed to get into the [Top 5 Infosec Books of 2014](http://www.rsaconference.com/blogs/the-best-information-security-book-of-2014-and-some-other-excellent-ones).

What's in store for 2015? More guests (both blog and podcast), more posts and hopefully more opportunities to meet people in-person.

Here's wishing everyone a safe & data-driven new year!
