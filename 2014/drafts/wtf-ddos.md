Sometimes you have to call it like it is and I could not resist re-posting something from [@wtfviz](https://twitter.com/wtfviz) today since it was a wonderfully awful data visualization (well, infographic) that had an infosec theme to it (@wtfviz posted the following snippet):

The image excerpt was from a [@visually](http://twitter.com/visually) [submission](http://visual.ly/global-trends-ddos-attacks) by @blockdos1.

Apart from the egregious of a (_shudder_) pie chart for that component of the infographic, there's bar chart which obviously slipped past the Q/A department in it as well:

The infographic also includes a "pac man" chart and a geography lesson (otherwise known as a an unwarranted use of a sparsely populated world map).

Rather than take a visual approach to "fudstats", BlockDos could have taken the data-driven security approach and produced a fact-based and statistically sound whitepaper on the sources, nature and impacts of denial of service attacks.
