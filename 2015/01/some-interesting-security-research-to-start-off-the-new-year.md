This morning, both [David Severski](http://twitter.com/dseverski) &amp; [Gabe the Engineer](http://twitter.com/gdbassett) shot me links to the [MC2 Workshop on Data-Driven Approaches to Security and Privacy](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/data-driven/) that was held at the University of Maryland recently (Jan 8-9). 

I couldn't find any proceedings or presentations from that conference, but I _did_ take a stroll through the Google Scholar profiles of the [participants](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/data-driven/#organizers) (focusing mostly on 2014 publications). Here are some papers and research efforts that I thought would be of most interest to the broader DDSec community:

- [AUTOPROBE: Towards Automatic Active Malicious Server Probing Using Dynamic Binary Analysis](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/guofei/paper/AutoProbe-CCS2014.pdf)
- [Targeted Threat Index: Characterizing and Quantifying Politically-Motivated Targeted Malware](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-hardy.pdf)
- [Analysis of SSL Certificate Reissues and Revocations in the Wake of Heartbleed](http://david.choffnes.com/pubs/Heartbleed-IMC.pdf)
- [Some Vulnerabilities Are Different Than Others](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~tdumitra/papers/RAID-2014.pdf)
- [Stream Computing for Large-Scale, Multi-Channel Cyber Threat Analytics](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~huxin/papers/xin_Stream.pdf)
- [MUSE: asset risk scoring in enterprise network with mutually reinforced reputation propagation](http://jis.eurasipjournals.com/content/pdf/s13635-014-0017-1.pdf)
- [Intentional Network Monitoring: Finding the Needle without Capturing the Haystack](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2014/papers/hotnets-XIII-final102.pdf)
- [PEERING: An AS for Us](http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2014/papers/hotnets-XIII-final159.pdf)

If you find some other interesting ones from the list of participants (or other ones in general), defintely drop a note in the comments with a link. We're not trying to duplicate [Jason Trost](http://twitter.com/jason_trost)'s excellent resource of papers at [http://www.covert.io/](http://www.covert.io/), so make sure to check that first before suggesting new ones.
