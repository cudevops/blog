_Need an opinon about the Sony hack?_

There are a lot of opinions out there attributing the recent breach of Sony
Pictures Entertainment to a variety of sources. Let's face it, you probably
don't know who hacked Sony. Unfortunately in the world of information security
it is pretty much expected that you will have a strong opinion about who did it
regardless of what you actually know or do not know.

We know what you're going through right now. You're probably avoiding the
discussion because you're ashamed to admit that you don't know what happened and
you don't want to look amateurish in the eyes of your peers. You probably spent
the holidays hoping that your family wouldn't bring up the subject and force you
to take a position on the attribution.

Well you don't need to hide any longer. Today we are proud to unveil the <a
href="http://sony.attributed.to">Sony Hack Attribution generator</a>!

### What's this all aboot?

Every time you visit the  <a
href="http://sony.attributed.to">Sony Hack Attribution generator</a> you'll get a new
explanation of the attack with randomly selected threat actor and a randomly
selected country of origin. The actors and countries are weighted using the
frequencies in the <a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/">Data
Breach Investigations Report</a> and the <a href="http://vcdb.org/">VERIS
Community Database</a> so you'll know that your story is at least kind of
plausible too!

At the very least, it will be based on data that has been
collected from breaches in over 95 countries, with 50 different organizations
which are arguably the same size or bigger then SPE. That is more evidence 
than what has been actually shared so far.

### Is any of this true?

_Noooo_, but CNN doesn't need to know that. The most important thing is having a
strong opinion and getting it out there quickly so you can get recognition and
twitter followers. After the whole story is told you'll be remembered as one of
the people who helped shape our understanding of international cyber security
incidents and the appropriate foreign policy response.

Most of the report details, quotes and IOCs are purely made up for flavor. 
If we have quoted you as a real person, we probably like you and think you 
made good arguments against the original attribution.

### I wish it had more countries to blame

Come on over to <a href="https://github.com/blackfist/sonyhack">the github
repository</a>! As @bfist likes to say, we welcome your pull request. The whole
app was written in ruby just to irritate @hrbrmstr, but that has the side benefit
of making the code easy to understand and customize.

Also, @alexcpsec did not write a single line of code to contribute to this,
but he will always claim that he had the original idea and inspired the DDSec
team to make this happen. A true thought leader!
