Tales of Lifelong Learning: EconSec101x Economics of Cybersecurity

I was thrilled to be invited to share my perspective after taking a rather unique MOOC offering - Economics of CyberSecurity.

The course was part of edX's first "Professional Education" batch - a series of fee-based courses tailored to professionals. The fee for EconSec was USD 250 (I paid for it out-of-pocket).


The course starts





While not mandatory, having some notions of microeconomics helps, particularly for weeks 1 and 4. For me, the knowledge I got during Coursera's Microeconomics Principles helped.

Week 3, on Security Strategy, had a discussion on insurance topics where having some notion of Probability and Statistics helped too. 



As for the MOOC platform, I have a preference for Coursera over edX. I find the edX navigation inefficient, with poor use of screen real estate 


Was it worth it? While I may be biased by the 'endowment effect', I think it was. I was looking for the conceptual bridge between economic theory and typical information/cyber security topics. While there's a ton more that could be covered, the course was able to do that very well.
