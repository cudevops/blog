[Antonio Augusto](https://plus.google.com/105019627635291370658), an MS student researcher in Brazil, is conducting a survey to find out what security analysts find to be the more troublesome area where machine learning can help. He asked if we could get the word out, so please take the time to read his request (below) and [fill out his survey](http://goo.gl/forms/5xoo4Yr6PU)! This is *your* chance to help defenders and further bridge the (huge) gap between academia and information security.

>There has been a lot of work on this area in recent years, which tries to bring some improvements on the way we deal with alerts. However, the academia has no way to know which approach will be most beneficial to the system analyst.
 
>We are trying to fill this gap, and would really appreciate your help. We have devised a simple survey, which will help us discover which areas of the IDS you think needs more improvement.  It will take only about 10 minutes from your time to answer the survey.
 
>We have forms in English and Portuguese; choose the one will feel more comfortable with. Please, answer only one version of the form.
 
>Also, if you can, please forward this message to any of your friends that work with IDSs, the more people we have, the better.
 
>Thanks a lot for your help!
 
>The form in English: [http://goo.gl/forms/5xoo4Yr6PU](http://goo.gl/forms/5xoo4Yr6PU)

>The form in Portuguese: [http://goo.gl/forms/VhZOnIr3PF](http://goo.gl/forms/VhZOnIr3PF)

As Antonio says, please re-blog or get the word out to your colleagues.
