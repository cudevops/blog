Straight from the Book of PEP

1. thou shalt have no other languages before me
2. thou shalt not compare me to R
3. thou shalt not take the name of python or scikit-learn in vain
4. keep holy the juypter notebook
5. honour thy pip and thy modules
6. thou shalt not ^C any running program, but shall exit cleanly
7. thou shalt not "experiment" with R
8. thou shalt utilize the whole CPU for thine is a single thread
9. thou shalt not defame lesser languages (e.g. all of them)
10. thou shalt not attempt to reproduce in python what others do in R
