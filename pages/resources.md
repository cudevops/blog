**Data Cleansing**

- [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) : an open source, locally-installed, cross-platform toolkit that makes it extremely easy to import, explore, clean, transform, and enrich messy data into something usable for analysis.
- [DataWrangler](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/) : An browser-based, JavaScript tool created by Stanford University's Visualization Group that lets you explore and transform small data sets in-browser, then export a custom Python or JavaScript source file, suitable for running locally on both small and large data sets.
- [WebPlotDigitizer](http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/) : This online tool makes it possible to quickly "reverse engineer" charts and graphs that have no associated open data files. 
- [Google CRUSH Tools](https://code.google.com/p/crush-tools/) : A command-line processing engine and data transformation tool that makes it possible to work efficiently with large data sets from a shell prompt.
- [csvkit](https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit) : A suite of open source Python utilities that are similar to the CRUSH tools, but usable from both the command line and within Python scripts.
- [Data Cleaner](http://datacleaner.org/) : This product is similar to OpenRefine but with both commercial and open source offerings.
- [Mr. Data Converter](http://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/) : In-browser and locally installable open source tool created by Shan Carter to improve data cleansing workflows at the New York Times.
- [Miso Dataset](http://misoproject.com/dataset/) : Client-side JavaScript data transformation and management library.
- [Your favorite scripting language]: Never underestimate the power of a Python, R, Perl or awk script when it comes to cleaning data. You'll have to do more up-front work, but you may be able to build a far more reusable and customized cleanup and transformation workflow with your own tools.

**Data Analytics & Visualization : Core Tools**

- [R](http://www.r-project.org/) + [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) : The language of data science. Commercial offering available via [Revolution Analytics](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/).
- [Python](http://www.python.org/) + [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) : The other language of data science. Additional open source and commercial offerings available via [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) and Continuum Analytics [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html).
- [Tableau](http://www.tableausoftware.com/) : Commercial tool with an emphasis on producing interactive dashboards and visualizations.

**Data Analytics & Visualization : JavaScript Tools**

- [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) : Enables the creation of Ã’data driven documents" and provides templates and examples for creating almost every type of modern static and interactive visualization.
- [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://philogb.github.io/jit/) : Similar to D3, but may be more accessible to those new to JavaScript
- [Highcharts JS](http://www.highcharts.com/) : Provides robust charting and graphing funtions, especially well-suited for dashboards.

**Data Analytics & Visualization : Mapping Tools**

- [OpenHeatMap](http://www.openheatmap.com/) : Produce high quality heat maps from CSV data right in your browser. No coding required.
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) : A very robust and mobile-friendly, JavaScript mapping library.

**Data Analytics & Visualization : Specialized Tools**

- [TimeFlow](https://github.com/FlowingMedia/TimeFlow/wiki) : An open source tool specifically design for analysis and visualization of temporal/time series data.
- [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) : Open source network graph analysis and visualizatin tool.
- [Quadirgram](http://www.quadrigram.com/) : This tool provides a visual programming interface for working with data and designing highly customized, interactive visualization.

**Aggregation Sites, Q&A Sites, And Blogs To Follow**
