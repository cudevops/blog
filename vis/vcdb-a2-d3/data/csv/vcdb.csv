The breach began on September 13 and was allowed to continue until January so that the hackers' behavior could be studied.

(Steel v. Coast Capital Savings Credit Union, 2013 BCSC 527)  Employees at Coast were permitted to have a personal folder in which they would keep confidential business documents. Under the privacy policy at Coast, the files in the personal folder could only be read or edited by the employee who had the folder. Help desk employees were allowed to access personal folders but could only do so to resolve a technical problem and only if the employee who had the personal folder first gave permission to the help desk to access the folder.  The restrictions on access to personal folders were clearly set out in the privacy policy at Coast.  An employee tried to open a confidential spreadsheet in her personal folder. She got a message on her screen that the document was already in use by the help desk. The document in question was a waiting list of employees for parking spots. This was a confidential document that had information about employees' seniority and rates of pay. The help desk employee had not requested permission to view the document in the other employee's personal folder. She accessed it because she was curious about the waiting list for parking.  Coast terminated her employment on the basis of breach of the trust ""that is required in a position that holds access to confidential and private information."" Coast stated that it no longer had confidence in her.  The Supreme Court decided that the help desk employee was in a position of trust because she was ""given the ability to access confidential documents"" as a result of her position on the help desk. She was not allowed to do that without the consent of the other employee. The Court stated that, ""the employer had to trust Ms. Steel to obey its policies and follow the protocols. It had to trust Ms. Steel to only access such documents as part of the performance of her duties and follow the protocols when she did so. Such trust was fundamental to the employment relationship in relation to Ms. Steel's position."" Accordingly, the Court upheld the termination for cause.  The Court's decision to uphold the termination for cause of an employee with over 20 years of service for a single breach of the privacy policy is a clear indication that Courts are prepared to treat privacy issues very seriously. If employees in a position of trust violate privacy policies, they may well be subject to termination for cause.","","CA","1001 to 10000","522130","","","","","","","","Coast Capital Savings Credit Union",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Partner","2013-08-23T23:36:00Z","","U","","","03EA3D0E-E90A-475D-9832-A3C2C369936A","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","4","7","2013"

Gary Dickson's office began an investigation into the Regina breach after 15 addressograph cards - blue cards attached to patients' charts when they go to a hospital for tests or admissions - were found on the ground near two facilities belonging to a document destruction company on May 20, 2010.  The cards contained personal information of patients who had been treated at the Pasqua and Regina General hospitals.  The privacy breach occurred when an employee of a document destruction company was transferring the cards in a container with a lid between two facilities. The container's lid was not secured and the cards flew out. They were discovered two days later by a member of the public.

Police say the laptop may have contained top-secret information. According to Ynet, Horev is in charge of Israel's nuclear policy.  Horev’s wallet, electronic devices and a number of work-related documents were also stolen after two thieves broke into his house in Moshav Beit Yitzhak, near Netanya, on Sunday.  A statement by the Atomic Energy Commission, however, has said that no sensitive material was stolen from Horev’s house. It also denied a computer was among the items stolen.  The AEC also said that it appears that the robbery was related to the nature of the Horev's work and that the robbers were common criminals.

The department paid $750 for two Bitcoins  an online currency  to decrypt several images and word documents in its computer system, Swansea Police Lt. Gregory Ryan said. It was an education for (those who) had to deal with it, Ryan said, adding that the virus did not affect the software program that the police department uses for police reports and booking photos. Ryan also said that no outside parties gained access to any personal information, and that the police department did not lose any files. We were never compromised, Ryan said.   CryptoLocker, a new Windows ransomware virus sweeping across the country, hit the Swansea Police Department on Nov. 6. The virus encrypted several files that could only be decrypted through the purchase of Bitcoins, an unregulated digital currency, to pay for the special decryption key. A countdown clock appeared on a computer screen showing how much time the department had to buy the key before all the files were deleted.  The Swansea Police Department bought the key and decrypted the files on Nov. 10.","","GB","11 to 100","922120","","","","","","","Wales","Swansea Police Department",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Unknown","","Unknown","Unknown","","Unknown",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Days","4","Encrypted until they paid the ransom.

The virus copied bank account passwords as she typed them.  The virus “tricked the [bookkeeper] into giving the trust account’s password to the fraudsters, allowing them essentially full access to the trust account, including the ability to go in, monitor it, and wire money to foreign countries shortly after deposits were made,” Pinnington adds.  Pinnington believes the hacking took place after the bookkeeper clicked on a link, opened an e-mail attachment or downloaded something as mundane as a screen saver from the Internet.  The built-in program, in this case, was the Trojan banker virus. It has an ability to mimic a bank’s web site and when a user types in a password, the program logs the keys and sends a transcript to the hackers in real time. An e-mail pretending to be from the bank may have provided the bookkeeper a link that launched into a spoof web site prompting her to log in, says Pinnington. But she couldn’t successfully gain access using her primary password.

Gregory Ward, co-owner of the South Main Street store, said his company was contacted by a bank regarding the possible security breach, after which Ward’s immediately reached out to law enforcement officials to cooperate with any investigation.  The exact number of cardholders or banks who’ve been affected is unknown, though local banks underscore that no account information has been compromised. It’s believed dozens of customers from various local and national banks had their credit or debit card information stolen and used to make fraudulent, in-person purchases around the world.

According to the Mandiant report, the cyberattack, which state sources say is believed to have originated inside Russia, started with a “phishing” scheme, a common tactic used by cyber criminals.   Last Aug. 13, a hacker sent multiple South Carolina Department of Revenue  employees a malicious email containing an embedded link containing malware or a computer virus. When at least one of the employees clicked on the link, the malware was activated and allowed the hacker to steal the employee’s user name and password.  From there, the hacker was off to the races. Two weeks later, the attacker logged onto the remote-access service for Department of Revenue computers, using the credentials of an employee who had clicked on the Aug. 13 email. The invader then “leveraged the user’s access rights to access other Department of Revenue systems and databases with the user’s credentials,” the report states.","","US","101 to 1000","9211","","","","","","","SC","South Carolina Department of Revenue",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","9699901","In addition to 3.8 million tax returns, including the Social Security numbers of 1.9 million children and other dependents, the hackers got access to data on 699,900 business tax returns and 3.3 million bank accounts.

A female foreign national employed by the U.S. Government, with whom the subject was having sexual relations, told another government employee that she suspected that the subject was listening to her telephone calls.  The other employee reported the incident.  The investigation determined that, from approximately 1998 to 2003, the employee tasked nine telephone numbers of female foreign nationals, without a valid foreign intelligence purpose, and listened to collected phone conversations while assigned to foreign locations.  The subject conducted call chaining on one of the numbers and tasked the resultant numbers.  He also incidentally collected the communications of a U.S. person on two occasions.","","US","25001 to 50000","92811","","","","","","","DC","US National Security Agency (NSA)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","Years","5","","","","1998","Other","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","","U","","","","","2013-09-28T06:05:00Z","","","","","10EF4DF6-0609-4B6A-9E6B-36B7E3EF510E","2013-09-28T06:05:00Z","11","9","2013"

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department first learned of the scam after a customer found one of the small video cameras on the floor -- having apparently fallen off a ticket vending machine.  Authorities went on to find hidden cameras attached to seven machines at four LIRR stations: Bayside and Great Neck on the Port Washington branch, Merillon Avenue on the Huntington/Port Jefferson branch, and Greenvale on the Oyster Bay branch. MTA Police Chief Michael Coan said the cameras, mounted on a small, black metal strip attached with an adhesive, were made to look like they were part of the ticket vending machines.","","US","1001 to 10000","485112","4","","","","","","NY","The Long Island Rail Road Company",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","","","Processed","no implanted skimming device, but camera attached to record info entered into the terminal.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Ext - customer","","","","Unknown","First pass","whbaker","","U","","","","Customer","2013-10-28T18:44:00Z","","","626","","1209234C-90B8-4FD2-BC6E-1B9D61A33B6F","2013-10-28T18:44:00Z","","10","2013"

It resulted in the “Patras” server being closed down – meaning that federal police had to halt operations tracking suspects and their vehicles. Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich subsequently said computer security would be made a top priority.  Der Spiegel magazine reported on Sunday that the Frankfurt officer concerned had put a Trojan program on his daughter’s computer to monitor her activities in the internet.

Upon investigation, Yale concluded that the computer file had been stored for 10 months in a way that left the information in the file searchable using Google.    Upon further investigation, Yale determined that the affected computer file was created in 1999 and was inadvertently moved to an insecure section of the computer server in July 2005.  Although, from July 2005, the file was no longer fully protected from unauthorized public access, it could not be located using an ordinary internet search engine.  The situation changed in September 2010, when Google modified its search engine in a way that allowed it to search files stored on servers like the one holding the affected Yale file.  As a result, between September 2010 and July 1, 2011, it was possible that information in the affected file, including SSNs might have been located through a Google search.","","US","10001 to 25000","6113","","","","","","","CT","Yale University",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Unknown","","Unknown","Unknown","","Unknown",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","Months","10","","","9","2010","Int - reported by user","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","","Y","","","","Unknown","2013-10-10T17:46:00Z","","","","","12D929E4-7D38-4B39-B190-0CB5CD2EA150","2013-10-10T17:46:00Z","9","8","2011"

The hacker, going by the name @TibitXimer on Twitter, told ZDNet earlier this evening that the hack was carried out earlier this year on July 12, which allowed him to gain root access to the server holding the customer data. Tibit gained access to a server with little difficulty after working with another hacker to identify the security flaw.  Updated on December 22 at 8:00 p.m. ET: Verizon spokesperson Alberto Canal told ZDNet in an emailed statement: ""We have examined the posted data and we have confirmed that it is not Verizon Wireless customer data. Our systems have not been hacked.""  The hacker said in a later tweet the data likely belongs to Verizon FiOS fiber customers, rather than Verizon Wireless cellular customers.

Anyone can anonymously start or join a discussion about local drug dealers, complaints about the Fairfax County police or schools, places to meet women, politics, breaking news, all manner of things of interest to Northern Virginians. It is largely uncensored, so the content can be sexist, racist, vulgar or offensive, sometimes all in one post.  It wasn’t particularly surprising, then, that someone anonymously obtained and posted a file Tuesday with the detailed grades of more than 2,000 Fairfax High School students in hundreds of different courses from the 2011-12 school year. On Wednesday, the Fairfax County School Board’s lawyers sent the site’s founder and administrator, Cary Wiedemann, an e-mail requesting that he immediately take the file down. Wiedemann declined, saying he did not post the file and did not see any law which prohibited the disclosure of the grades, and that there was no personal information such as social security numbers or home addresses. He also asked if anyone could verify that it was actual, accurate school data.   -----------------------  Due to the content and publicity associated with the thread Leaked! Fairfax High School Report Cards from 2011-2012 School Year for Every Student! 2,166 page PDF file, the Fairfax County School Board has filed suit against Fairfax Underground and was granted a temporary preliminary injunction by the US District Court of Alexandria, VA.  As the order was issued without notice I was not provided any chance to respond to the school board's petition. I have a very limited time to file a Motion to Dissolve, and am currently exploring the merits of doing so, but as the injunction expires on January 4th, 2013 I may well abide by this temporary order and focus my efforts on ensuring the injunction doesn't become permanent.  In compliance with the injunction I am currently performing a full MySQL database backup to preserve all of the original records, as I need to modify the offending post in order to remove the content.","","US","25001 to 50000","611110","","","2.46e+09","USD","","","VA","Fairfax High School",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","2000","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Student","2013-02-21T05:57:15Z","","N","","","1E541AF0-D9E1-4A91-9E03-942D2DC633EA","2013-12-06T19:26:49Z","21","12","2012"

Derrick Hill, 53, of Woodlawn, previously pleaded guilty to the charges, along with co-conspirators Renee Cabell, 51, John Coffey, 43, and Tawney King, 46.  Authorities said Hill and the other defendants stole identities, then cashed counterfeit checks and rented apartments in the names of victims. Cabell provided Hill with the names and identity information of doctors who applied for fellowships at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Cabell worked. King, who was employed by Highlandtown Community Health Center, provided Hill with the identifying information of patients.  The rest of the defendants have been sentenced to a few years of prison for each, the U.S. Justice Department said.","","US","10001 to 25000","622110","","","","","1","Highlandtown Community Health Center","MD","Johns Hopkins Medical",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","250","Potential employees at Johns Hopkins; patients at Highlandtown Community Health Center","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","Yes","U","","Y","","Partner","2013-08-25T21:43:18Z","","U","","","1E8BF375-1468-4079-AF75-ED43DFEE63B4","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","25","3","2013"

The devices, discovered this week, are designed to copy personal bank card information and pass codes for thieves.  Authorities said the devices may have been in place for weeks. They are urging people who may have used the machines to check their financial statements.   The devices were found Tuesday at an ATM near the lobby gift shop of the Inova Fairfax Hospital Cardiac Care Center and on Wednesday at an ATM next to the cafeteria at Inova Fair Oaks Hospital.  Police said that in one case, a hospital employee found the skimmer when she tried to insert her ATM card and the device fell off the machine. Police said a hospital security guard found the other skimmer.","","US","Unknown","621111","","","","","","","VA","Inova Fairfax Hospital",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Other","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-02-23T03:37:34Z","","N","","","21FC25F2-D32E-44EF-8FBA-FB08A9D2D8A2","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","30","11","2012"

Smith pled guilty on July 31, 2012. According to court documents, Smith was employed as a staffing manager by A Caring Hand Home Health Care Services, Inc. (A Caring Hand), a business located in Suffolk, Virginia that was owned and operated by Janice W. Holland.  A Caring Hand was authorized to provide home health care services, including respite care, to recipients of Medicaid.  Respite care services, as authorized by applicable Medicaid regulations, are designed to provide temporary, substitute care for a Medicaid recipient that is normally provided by the family or another unpaid primary caregiver of the recipient.  These services are provided on a short-term basis because of the emergency absence, or the need for routine or periodic relief of the primary caregiver.   From in or about January 2008 through October 2011, Holland engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain health care benefit payments from the Virginia Medicaid program.  Holland submitted to the program approximately 900 fraudulent claims for payment representing that respite care services had been provided to thirty (30) Medicaid recipients, when in fact no such services had actually been provided.  As a result, Holland obtained health care benefit payments totaling approximately $630,000 to which she was not entitled.   During the period from in or about September 2010 through October 6, 2011, Holland and Smith, and members of the staff of A Caring Hand at their direction, altered, falsified and made false entries in the office records of A Caring Hand to conceal and cover up the fact that Holland had submitted false and fraudulent claims for payment to the Virginia Medicaid program.  On multiple occasions, Holland and Smith met with staff members and directed them to alter, falsify and make false entries into office records, including the creation of false and fraudulent time sheets, in order to make it appear that the respite care services for which Holland had billed the program had actually occurred, when in fact they knew that no such services had been provided.  Approximately twelve staff members knowingly committed the alteration and falsification of office records at the direction of Holland and Smith, who were aware of an upcoming scheduled audit of the office records.  Holland and Smith committed these acts with the intent to impede, obstruct and influence the proper administration of the Virginia Medicaid program, which is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services.","","US","Unknown","62111","","","","","","","VA","A Caring Hand Home Health Care Services, Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","30","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","31","1","2008","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Patient","2013-02-22T00:25:13Z","","N","","","22DF31DA-B032-4180-A4F7-22A9536E46C9","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","17","12","2012"

Switzerland has come under growing international pressure to change its banking secrecy laws, which other governments say enables many of their wealthy citizens to avoid taxes.  German-born Lutz Otte, appearing before the Swiss criminal court in a striped polo shirt and jeans, said that he had intended to use the bulk of a 1.1 million-euro ($1.5 million) reward to pay off taxes he owed in Germany.  ""The pressure from the finance authorities was pretty great. I saw an opportunity to alleviate the pressure on myself,"" Otte, who moved to Switzerland from Germany in 2005, said in court.  He said he left it to a German accomplice to pay the back taxes in Germany, but had no knowledge of whether the middleman had done so.  Judges ruled that Otte can serve half his three-year sentence, for breaching Swiss banking laws, industrial espionage and money laundering, on probation. Including time already served, he may be released in as soon as six months.  He had confessed to collecting data on wealthy German and Dutch clients from computer applications at Zurich-based Julius Baer between October and December 2011, as agreed with the German middleman.  Otte sent 15 emails from his work computer to his private account with attachments containing client names, addresses, account numbers, account balances and currencies, according to the arraignment.  He then filtered the data for German clients with more than 100,000 euros, Swiss francs, pounds sterling or U.S. dollars and sent a sample of the information to his accomplice, who he met in Berlin in February 2012.  There, he handed over data on 2,700 German clients to be transferred to the German tax authorities and agreed on payment of 1.1 million euros, although prosecutors said they could only recover 140,000 euros from his accounts.  Julius Baer agreed in 2011 to pay German tax authorities 50 million euros ($66.47 million) to close a tax investigation, but is still under investigation in the United States for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through secret Swiss accounts.  The bank didn't comment on the sentencing on Thursday.  German lawmakers last year struck down a deal aimed at allowing Swiss banks to levy taxes on German clients without revealing their identities.  Last week the two governments agreed on giving Swiss banks access to the German market without having to operate a subsidiary there, pending the introduction of new European Union-wide rules on cross-border banking coming into force.","","CH","1001 to 10000","523930","","","","","","","","Julius Baer",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","2700","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","Years","","","","10","2011","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-08-22T23:27:45Z","","U","","","25CAD94C-8005-400C-8F3F-526AB0B5A748","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","28","6","2013"

The latest snafu reportedly affects an estimated 34,000 current and former Pfizer employees who, of course, are now at risk for identity theft, according to an Aug. 24 letter to employees obtained by The Detroit News. The breach may have caused employee names, Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, bank account numbers, credit card info, signatures and other personal data to be publicly exposed.  The breach occurred late last year when a Pfizer employee removed copies of confidential info from a Pfizer computer system without the drugmaker’s knowledge or approval, the paper reports. Pfizer didn’t become aware of the breach until July 10.  The latest breach is likely the most serious, the News writes, because it appears the ex-employee ‘maliciously’ went after the data, according tod Judd Rousseau, chief operations officer of Identify Theft 911, an identity management company. “This appears to be an intentional theft which puts potential victims in the highest-risk category,” he says. “The perpetrator likely knew the value of this information.”","","US","Over 100000","325412","","","58990000","USD","","","NY","Pfizer, Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","34000","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2007","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","Y","","Y","","Partner","2013-02-22T16:38:45Z","","Y","","","2874BC09-B6F0-4BDA-8B82-526EFC0698B3","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","24","8","2007"

Based on a review of server logs, it is unlikely that the files have been accessed since 2008, outside of college personnel. Although it’s possible that this data could have been accessed by unauthorized individuals on the web, campus officials say they have no direct evidence that it has been discovered or used by anyone maliciously.  There was no credit card or financial information in these files. This is not the main web server, but one where a course instructor would typically post course syllabi and other relevant academic information. A very limited number of faculty files were involved. The files contained names and Social Security numbers. The files were immediately removed from the web server. We want to reiterate that this information was not placed on Vol State’s main site, www.volstate.edu. The server in question has been removed from the web.  We believe that most of the affected students are former students. Some of our instructors serve as an adjunct instructor at other institutions, so some information posted included a limited number of students attending other institutions.

The case against former Independence car dealer Terry Lee Morrow Jr., 25, had expanded significantly in the last week, since prosecutors filed their initial case involving eight victims, Koster said.  The amount of fraudulent loans has more than doubled to $1,036,522, and Morrow’s alleged take has gone from about $170,000 to $470,000 in cash, Koster said.  Morrow allegedly used personal information he obtained from former and prospective customers at his car lot to create fraudulent car loans.  He first operated Edge Auto Sales in the 3500 block of Southwest U.S. 40 in Blue Springs but later moved it to 211 E. U.S. 24 in Independence, court records said.  Between October 2011 and April 2012, Morrow generated illegal car loans by using personal information from former customers in the dealership’s files, court records alleged.  Using his customer’s names, birthdates and Social Security numbers, Morrow fabricated addresses and other details, according to the charges.  With the paperwork complete, Morrow then allegedly sold the loans to four automotive finance companies, which then tried to collect, Koster said. But because Morrow had used fake addresses, the finance companies had trouble finding the victims, who were unaware that he had signed them up for the loans.","","US","Unknown","441","","","","","","","MO","Edge Auto Sales",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","44","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","10","2011","Ext - customer","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-02-13T18:34:43Z","","N","","","3124B1F6-2355-4F55-BBFC-7F3A7239CBC3","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","12","2","2013"

James Scalzo, 46, who also worked as a loan officer at Fox River State Bank in Burlington, Wisc., pled guilty to money-laundering and bank fraud charges earlier this year after admitting in a plea agreement that he originated and approved fraudulent loans at both FIs in 2008-2009, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.  Scalva was ordered to serve three years supervised release following his prison term and to pay $200 in special assessments, the press release said, with the terms of restitution to be determined at a later date.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office said Scalvo’s actions caused personal and financial hardship to numerous victims, including a couple whose home was pledged as collateral for a fraudulent loan and then allowed to go into foreclosure.","","US","Unknown","522130","","","","","","","IL","Consumer's Credit Union",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-08-25T21:24:00Z","","U","","","31B10B02-12DA-4A3C-905C-EFBBDDA6A2E1","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","22","7","2013"

An internal audit revealed the illegal access. DVS says there are no indications that the data is being used for criminal purposes, but the agency is sending letters to affected individuals to make them aware of the breech.  The DVS says an audit revealed that an employee at a Minnesota car dealer who was authorized to access vehicle data to process consumer sales allegedly provided his system login information to a friend who worked at a vehicle repossession company.  That individual, who did not have authorization to access Minnesota vehicle records, either viewed the data or allowed others within the company to view it.

Festus Ighalo, 36, of Virginia Beach and Emmanuel Effiong, 35, of Dallas, Texas, are charged with conspiracy to defraud the government, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and numerous counts of aggravated identity theft.  Effiong maintains his innocence, according to his attorney, Paul Todd Sartwell. He said that the two men were roommates in Virginia Beach, but that Effiong moved to Texas about the time the alleged scheme began.   The 47-count indictment doesn’t specify where ­Ighalo and Effiong worked, but several of the victims were patients at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. All were patients of Sentara medical facilities in Virginia Beach, documents said.  According to the Virginia Department of Health Professions, both men were licensed last year as nurse’s aides. ­Ighalo’s license remains in good standing.  The scheme stretched from about September 2011 through April 2013, the indictment said. The men would take names, birth dates and Social Security numbers and give them to other people. Those accomplices, not identified in the indictment, would file false income tax returns collect refunds.","","US","Unknown","622110","","","","","","","VA","Sentara General Hospital",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","3700","","Stored","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","Years","","","","9","2011","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Patient","2013-08-22T23:05:24Z","","U","","","32F4DDA3-EEBC-40B2-8815-A30CD20C35EA","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","8","8","2013"

At a meeting of the Faculty Senate last week, ASU human resources employees said that number has grown to 215.

Stephen Miller, of Bridgemark Healthcare, apologized for the clerical error that resulted in approximately 800 plan participants receiving the list with all 800 social security numbers clearly visible.  In a written statement he says,  All impacted individuals are being enrolled in a comprehensive identity theft protection program, in addition to credit monitoring and fraud alert services, at no cost to them.  This coverage is retroactive to the mailing date and will extend for multiple years.  Well stay in touch with the folks at Bridgemark Healthcare about their promise to protect workers.

On Wednesday night, usernames and passwords utilized by Syracuse Police personnel on a police department website began appearing on another site frequented by hackers. There was never any access to police files or any sensitive information contained on police department servers.  “Because it's a completely different system. The internal website is completely encrypted and has a lot of security on it,” said Syracuse Police Department Sgt. Thomas Connellan.

Before assigning blame, the school wants to wait for two reviews looking into whether an employee failed to follow policy by backing up confidential employee information to a device stolen 10 days ago.  According to UVic’s Information Security Policy, data such as social insurance numbers and financial information must be stored within a controlled-access system with the file being password protected or encrypted. The device must also be locked away.  The university has said the information on the stolen device was not encrypted or password protected, though it was locked up.","","CA","1001 to 10000","611310","","","","","","","","University of Victoria",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-02-13T04:08:59Z","","N","","","3AC09D02-942D-4428-A485-220E33364507","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","20","1","2012"

The court ordered Herve Falciani's release on the prosecutor's recommendation, which argues that Falciani was co-operating with authorities in several European countries in investigations on tax, money-laundering, corruption and terrorism financing. The prosecutor noted Falciani has been detained for some time and that his extradition case could drag on.  He was ordered to hand over his passport, not to leave Spain and to appear before police every three days. He was also told to establish a residence in Spain and to inform authorities if he moved house.  Falciani, a French-Italian citizen, has been jailed provisionally since being arrested July 1 in Barcelona on a Swiss warrant. He had previously fled Switzerland to France.  The data he allegedly stole about 24,000 customers of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary potentially exposed many people to prosecution by tax authorities in their home countries.  Falciani, who obtained the information between late 2006 and early 2007 when he worked in the bank's information technology development unit, passed the list to French authorities. France's former Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, now head of the International Monetary Fund, later relayed the list to many European Union countries and the United States. France said there were up to 130,000 names involved.","","CH","Over 100000","551111","","","105800000","USD","","","","HSBC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","154700","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2006","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-02-23T03:50:19Z","","N","","","3D4475F7-6BC1-4BF3-8A60-93F0358C145A","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","18","12","2012"

In addition, Ag3nt47 has posted on Pastebin the names, addresses, email addresses, passwords, and other contact information of around 85 individuals.  I can’t confirm if the leaked data genuinely comes from the systems of Atlanta Chapter of the US Federal Bar Association (FBA).

The nurse who apparently first received the image did not respond to an email request for comment. The B.C. Nurses Union notes that a patient privacy breach is a serious allegation, and it is awaiting the outcome of VIHA’s investigation before commenting.  The alleged privacy breach occurred July 4 at Royal Jubilee Hospital. It was reported to VIHA’s information stewardship, access and privacy department the next day.  “We were made aware on July 5 a physician with hospital privileges was alleged to have taken a photo of a patient and sent it to parties that had no direct care relationship with the patient or appeared to not to have a direct relationship with the parties,” said VIHA spokeswoman Suzanne Germain.  The morbidly obese patient was unconscious and in the intensive-care unit following a procedure when the doctor allegedly photographed him with his cellphone and sent the picture to a friend, who may have forwarded it to others.  “We take the privacy and confidentiality of our patients extremely seriously,” Germain said. “We can confirm that an investigation is underway into an alleged privacy breach that occurred at Royal Jubilee Hospital.”  VIHA did not immediately inform the patient of the alleged breach because it said the patient was very sick, it did not have full facts and information.” In a privacy breach situation, VIHA said its first mandate is to stop the spread of the breach.  But when the investigation became public Wednesday and VIHA received requests from patients concerned they were the subjects of the photographs, VIHA contacted the patient and his family.  The doctor talked to the patient about the incident, VIHA said.  The three-week-old investigation is in its “fact-finding stage.” The College of Physicians and Surgeons said it is aware of the alleged patient privacy breach but is not investigating as it has no first-hand information about the alleged incident.  Generally speaking the college would be very critical of a patient privacy breach, spokeswoman Susan Prins said.  If VIHA determines the patient’s privacy rights were violated, the health authority could review the hospital privileges of the doctor — an independent contractor. The college is the authority that issues discipline.  VIHA officials would not comment on whether the physician has been investigated by the health authority before.  But this is not the first time that such an privacy breach has occurred in VIHA. A doctor at Cowichan District Hospital was accused of a similar breach earlier this year.  Despite protections and policies in place related to patient privacy and confidentiality, earlier this year, before either incident, VIHA began developing a new policy around photographing, videotaping and audio recording in VIHA service areas in part because of the rapidly changing technology for handheld devices.","","CA","Unknown","622","","","","","","","","Royal Jubilee Hospital",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","1","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","4","7","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Patient","2013-08-23T00:47:51Z","","U","","","3F99B184-3F80-471F-B0AA-08ABF748F399","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","25","7","2013"

A company spokesman confirmed a report in Manager Magazin to this effect, and said a limited number of staff members have had access to employees' personal data that ought to have been kept in anonymous form only. He added that there were no signs that the information had been misused. He said the supervisory board had apologised to staff. An external auditor will be commissioned to investigate the privacy breach, and the works council wants a lawyer to be involved, too.  Handelsblatt said this case is embarassing to the company as CEO Rene Obermann has expanded data protection in recent years and even set up a separate directorate for the issue. Three years ago, a former security head was sentenced for participating in illegal spying on journalists and employee representatives on the supervisory board.","","DE","Over 100000","51721","","","","","","","","Deutsche Telekom AG",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","","U","","","","Other","2013-09-01T22:58:00Z","","","","","3FA8166F-08C5-4795-B31C-8F273FBCA628","2013-09-01T22:58:00Z","29","8","2013"

Natural Provisions, Inc. agreed to pay $15,000 in civil penalties, an additional $15,000 in upgrades for its information technology systems, and to take the steps necessary to prevent future data breaches.  The settlement resulted from a security data breach due to credit card fraud at one of its stores. The store learned of the fraud after local police responded to reports from customers that credit card numbers were being stolen and used, tracing it to the Natural Provisions grocery. The store processed about 5,500 transactions a month. Prior to notification, tens of thousands of dollars of credit card fraud took place and some customers had their credit card information stolen a second time after, being unaware that the store was the site of the fraud, they used their replacement cards to make new purchases at the store. Natural Provisions, a company specializing in the sale of organic and natural foods, said it was unaware of the regulations required by the Vermont Security Breach Notice Act because it did not have an IT person on staff and had relied on a consulting group to ensure their security.

According to Motley’s plea agreement, she was a former state employee who stole identities from state databases and sold them to co-conspirators.  As evidence presented at the sentencing hearing showed, Motley had previously worked for the Alabama State Employees’ Insurance Board and stole the personal information of over 100 state workers and their family members from the databases maintained by the board.  She provided this information to Veronica Temple, Yolanda Moses and Barbara Murry, who used the stolen identities to file false tax returns that fraudulently requested tax refunds from the IRS.

The bank filed the lawsuit in federal court against former vice president Sandra D. Kokoska, former assistant vice president Kimberly A. Barnum, and mortgage department employees, Stewart P. McCaw, Lisa A. Musgrave, Carrie J. Swaniger and Marcie A. Lipscomb.  The lawsuit alleges that the former employees committed a ""brazen and egregious theft of trade secrets"" when they abruptly resigned April 14 and opened a new loan origination office for MVB Bank in Cranberry Square, Morgantown, on April 18.  Huntington claims that the defendants spent weeks leading up to their resignations downloading and printing confidential customer records from the bank's secure database -- records they then used to solicit Huntington's existing and prospective customers.  ""These customer records did not merely include customer names, addresses and telephone numbers,"" the lawsuit said. ""In addition, the defendants took with them what is presently known to be over 2,000 customer Social Security numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and other highly confidential, personal information of Huntington's customers, the unwitting victims of this theft.""  The lawsuit also claims that the former employees took the files of some customers who had filed active mortgage loan applications -- files which included their paystubs, W-2s, tax returns and other sensitive information -- often without the customers' knowledge or consent.

The theft occurred on property that Seton leases at the Chevy Chase building, 7715 Chevy Chase Drive, from a secure office. A security camera captured video of the thief carrying out a laptop and projector and that information has been provided to the Austin Police Department.  The data captured on the stolen computer contains information from a shared database that is utilized by Seton as well as several other area healthcare providers to determine if patients seeking medical attention who are uninsured may be eligible for other funding sources.  Patients who sought care as part of an outpatient, clinic or ED visit since July 1, 2005, and presented without health insurance are those individuals whose information may be included on the stolen computer. After reviewing back-up data, current estimates indicate that approximately 7,800 individuals may be impacted. Seton is working closely with the other healthcare providers to notify all impacted patients.","","US","10001 to 25000","622110","","","","","","","TX","Seton Healthcare",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Potentially","7800","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2006","Int - reported by user","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","","U","","","","Patient","2013-10-22T21:03:00Z","","","","","44B59436-4ECB-4D16-97AC-F798676BB227","2013-10-22T21:03:00Z","19","2","2006"

No further details on the attack were given.  Currently all compromised systems are closed off and the company is working to restore them.  According to the email, no financial information was reached since Ubisoft has a payment processing company handle money-related data. “Please note that no personal payment information is stored with Ubisoft, meaning your debit/credit card information was safe from this intrusion” the e-mail reads.  “Out of an abundance of caution, we also recommend that you change your password on any other Web site or service where you use the same or a similar password.”","","FR","1001 to 10000","511210","","","","","","","","UBISOFT Entertainment (France)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Unknown","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-08-23T16:03:54Z","","U","","","4570A114-D2A9-4F50-8634-BD89469468F1","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","2","7","2013"

According to the US Department of Justice, between 2002 and 2004, Musacchio was the president of a third-party logistics company called Exel Transportation Services.  In 2004, the man left the firm and founded a competing company, Total Transportation Services.  Between 2004 and 2006, Musacchio and two other Exel employees that joined him at Total hacked into the email accounts of their former employer in an effort to obtain proprietary business information which they used for their own benefit.  Musacchio, found guilty of one felony count of conspiracy to make unauthorized access to a protected computer and two substantive felony counts of hacking, will be sentenced on June 14.  His accomplices, Joseph Roy Brown and John Michael Kelly, who have already pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them, will also be sentenced in the upcoming period.","","US","1 to 10","488510","","","270000","USD","","","GA","Exel Transportation Services",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2006","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Other","2013-07-02T16:34:58Z","","N","","","48D6884D-5008-437C-B304-C089890A903A","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","4","3","2013"

New evidence suggests the privacy breach dated back at least two weeks. +  Quartz reported yesterday that the data files sent from Tinder’s servers to its apps had been revealing sensitive information about users, including their last known location and Facebook ID. Reaction to the piece centered on the fact that Tinder hasn’t disclosed the issue to its users. CEO Sean Rad said one reason they haven’t is that the breach didn’t last very long: ”An engineer basically found a hole that was there for like an hour,” he said in an interview yesterday. +  But that wasn’t the first time the issue reared its head. Interviews with several people who have worked with Tinder’s API, which is how the company’s servers communicate with its apps, extend the timeline of the privacy breach considerably. Exactly when the issue began and at what points it remained a problem are still unclear. The company won’t provide details on the timing. +  Rad hasn’t returned emails and phone calls seeking comment today. Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for IAC, which owns Tinder, acknowledged the earlier breach but said it was fixed quickly, which isn’t supported by Quartz’s reporting. In a statement today, Sacco said: +      On two different occasions, we became aware that our API was returning information that it should not have been. In both occasions, we promptly addressed and fixed the glitch. With respect to location data, we do not store the current location of a Tinder user but rather a vague/inaccurate point in space. We are extremely committed to upholding the highest standards of privacy and will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure our users’ data is protected from internal and external sources.     +  Tinder informed on July 8  Mike Soares, an engineer in San Francisco, says he discovered the issue on July 8 and immediately informed the company in an email to help@gotinder.com. The subject line was, “Privacy Hole With Your App,” and it detailed how Tinder’s API was returning more information than necessary, including the location and Facebook data. +  Tinder needs to record each user’s last known location in order to suggest other people within a certain distance. But no one is supposed to see a user’s exact location, a privacy violation that could be considered especially egregious because Tinder is used to find people to hook up with. An introductory screen when first signing up for Tinder assures, “Your location will never be shown to other users.” ","","US","Small","511210","","","","","","","NY","Tinder",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Transmitted unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-08-25T21:59:04Z","","U","","","4A5D8DD7-F411-4580-A9FF-023CFA93AFD4","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","24","7","2013"

The Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) is informing 1,090 Medicaid clients by letter of a computer security breach that may have resulted in the unintentional release of information held by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services (HP ES), the vendor that manages Medicaid’s information management system.   In mid-November, an employee of Carewise Health, a subcontractor of HP ES, responded to a telephone computer scam, resulting in unauthorized remote access to a computer that contained a database with information on the Medicaid clients. HP ES and Carewise Health disabled the laptop as soon as the breach was reported, and notified CHFS. Typically such scams are targeted at charging people for unnecessary computer services. While there is no evidence that the confidential contents of the database were accessed, the hacker did have access to the employee’s laptop for a brief period. The database included health and other information about the individuals being notified, including social security numbers for less than half the individuals. HP ES is arranging for those affected to receive free credit monitoring to detect identity theft for one year.  ","There is a conflict in how many records were released.

He said the information hadn't been stolen and the centre would continue to operate, but admitted it would be very difficult without patient records.

After a four day trial, the jury convicted Echols of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and six counts of false statements relating to health care matters.   According to evidence presented at trial, Echols was a physician practicing in the Houston area.  The evidence showed that Echols signed plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries so that fraudulent claims could be billed by Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care.  Echols would sign plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries who were not under his care and about whose conditions he had no knowledge.  In many instances, the evidence showed, Echols would sign plans of care even though other doctors were listed as the attending physician on the documents.    Evidence presented at trial showed that Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care fraudulently billed Medicare for home health services and were paid approximately $17.3 million by Medicare, including $5.5 million for beneficiaries for whom Echols signed a plan of care.   At trial, doctors in whose names claims were submitted to Medicare testified that they were treating the patients on plans of care signed by Echols, and that the patients did not need the care that had been billed to Medicare based on the plans. Two Medicare beneficiaries for whom Echols signed plans of care testified at trial that they had never seen Echols, that they had different primary care physicians, and they did not want or need home health care.","","US","Unknown","621111","","","","","","","TX","Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored"," At trial, doctors in whose names claims were submitted to Medicare testified that they were treating the patients on plans of care signed by Echols, and that the patients did not need the care that had been billed to Medicare based on the plans.

The database became apparent when the department confirmed to TAI that it had initiated an internal investigation into whether the private health information of thousands of people with HIV and their partners had been improperly released. The state’s investigation found that a contractor had emailed some data within the HIV Event System from a protected government server – without encryption – to an email address at the company that created and maintains the database for the state. The state determined that no private information was released.  According to Rick’s report, the violation occurred late last year when an employee of A.J. Boggs & Company — a subcontractor that provides technology services to MDCH — sent an unencrypted email attachment to the company’s CEO that included thousands of pages of health and demographic information from the state’s HIV database.","","US","1001 to 10000","94310000","","","","","","","MI","Michigan Department of Community Health",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","","","Transmitted unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-08-22T00:13:44Z","","N","","","50B355C7-176B-42D9-8305-35AA80419D63","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","17","5","2012"

But on the way home, she stopped off to visit an ill friend for 10 minutes, leaving the laptop on the front seat of her locked car. In that short timeframe, someone smashed the window of the car and stole the laptop. The theft was reported to the organization on January 9. UHCS reported the theft to the police and even hired a private detective to try to recover it. As of today, however, the laptop has not been recovered. Frustratingly for everyone, that laptop had password protection but no encryption as it was one of the last remaining laptops scheduled to be updated to add encryption.  It took the agency time to compile exactly what information was on the laptop, but using a roaming profile, they were able to determine that data on clients going back to 2002 were on the device. For some clients, the information may have been just a name and address, while for others it may have been name and date of birth, or name and Social Security number. According to the spokesperson, there were very few diagnostic codes or treatment service codes on the laptop.  All told, records on 1,318 United Home Care Services of Southwest Florida clients and 12,299 clients of United HomeCare Services, Inc. were on the stolen laptop  The 13,617  affected clients were sent a notification letter in February in compliance with Florida’s privacy rule that requires notification within 45 days. On March 8, they were sent a second letter to comply with HIPAA.","","US","101 to 1000","624190","","","","","","","FL","United Home Care Services",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","13617","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","8","1","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Patient","2013-06-28T04:34:07Z","","N","","","54D682E2-479C-4644-A504-872166386DC9","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","8","3","2013"

An SQL Injection vulnerability in the Navy’s website gave him access to the user data, Pinoy Hack News informs.

Back in September 2012, a hacker group called LulzSec International breached the site and leaked around a dozen account login details.

The stolen information was contained in a statement by a group with an Iranian-sounding name calling for an inquiry into Israel's nuclear activities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is investigating Iran's nuclear program.  The IAEA said the theft concerned ""some contact details related to experts working"" with the Vienna-based agency but it did not say who might have been behind the action.  A Western diplomat said the stolen data was not believed to include information related to confidential work carried out by the IAEA. One of the agency's tasks is preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.","","AT","Unknown","926130","","","","","","","","International Atomic Energy Agency",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Other","2013-02-22T04:54:02Z","","N","","","59E37F28-80F0-4805-A508-0D3FF39AC9C9","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","28","11","2012"

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had some of its servers hacked last week, the agency confirmed on Tuesday.  The 10 servers involved are used for reports from automakers about their plans for recalls, as well as for progress reports on continuing and past investigations. Normally, the information stored on the affected servers is public and can be located along with other information on recalls or defect investigations. But on Friday, the usually public documents became inaccessible.  The blockage was caused by an alert about a “cybersecurity incident” from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, an agency spokesman wrote in an e-mailed statement. The statement said that the episode “was limited in scope, involved systems which host publicly available information” and that no personal or confidential business information had been compromised.  The 10 servers that were attacked are no longer connected to the Internet, the agency said, and “countermeasures to return all equipment to normal operation” were under way. It wasn’t clear when the documents would be available again, and an agency spokesman declined to answer questions regarding the source of the attack.","","US","101 to 1000","92612","","","","","","","DC","National Highway Traffic Safety Administration",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"No","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Unknown","2013-08-21T23:20:49Z","","N","","","5AEAF0CE-7E92-4019-B7EF-AE1FB97B0028","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","6","8","2013"

At the heart of the lawsuit is a breach that involved a former emergency department worker of Florida Hospital Celebration. Over a two-year period from 2009 to 2011, the worker improperly accessed the electronic records of more than 763,000 patients treated at several Florida Hospital locations and sold personal information on about 12,000 patients to a co-conspirator, law enforcement officials say. That information was used to solicit legal and chiropractic services for patients involved in motor vehicle accidents, according to law enforcement officials (see: Prison Time for Health Data Theft).","","US","25001 to 50000","622110","","","4.36e+09","USD","","","FL","Adventist Health System/Florida Hospital Celebration",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","760000","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2011","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Patient","2013-06-06T17:52:21Z","","N","","","5B55E755-BB32-41D2-91F1-7200D1242ABE","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","23","1","2013"

This information was provided to three firms in connection with First Data„s efforts to evaluate effective verification and anti-fraud services. BAMS believes there is little risk of harm to you, however, we sincerely regret this error, as the security of your information is one of our top priorities at BAMS. First Data has been working to improve its customer acceptance experience while reducing fraud. To that end, First Data has been testing product offerings from two credit reporting agencies (one of which is a First Data subsidiary) and a fraud analytics company. As part of this testing initiative, in January and February 2012, First Data sent these three organizations certain data, including the name, address, and social security numbers of BAMS merchants. Please note that the data that First Data sent to the three companies is the same information routinely provided by BAMS to credit reporting agencies in the normal course of our merchant application underwriting and boarding process. The agencies that received the data are required to maintain the security and confidentiality of your information.

He testified that he received only one ""hit"" from the queries on the girlfriend.  Another number he queried, that of a foreign national language instructor, returned ""insignificant information"".  The subject claimed that he queried his name to see if anyone was discussing his travel and the telephone numbers to ensure that there were no security problems.","","US","25001 to 50000","92811","","","","","","","DC","US National Security Agency (NSA)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","Months","","","","","2005","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","","U","","","","Other","2013-09-28T06:26:00Z","","","398","","5F754B9D-D5ED-4903-85CA-411F499D7B92","2013-09-28T06:26:00Z","11","9","2013"

Rodriguez has never failed a drug test, at least not officially, yet commissioner Bud Selig and his minions want to suspend him for life. Rodriguez has a problem with that, especially the part where the New York Yankees get out of paying him the remaining $100 million left on his contract.  The evidence against A-Rod is based on stolen medical records obtained from Porter Fischer, an ex-employee of Biogenesis of America, an anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Florida. The clinic has since closed. Reportedly, MLB paid Fischer for the records. Fischer stole the medical records from Biogenesis of America because he believed the clinic owed him some money, $4,000 to be exact.

His name is Suriya Prakash, and his method of cultivating numbers involves using Facebook's mobile site to bypass security limits imposed on the social networking site's regular portal, or so he claims. Here's how he explains it.  ""About a month ago I was just browsing Facebook on my Facebook mobile application and it had an option called 'Find friends using contacts' -- what it does is that it compares the contact list from your phone to the Facebook database to see if you have any friends that are in your contacts but not on your Facebook account,"" Prakash told The Next Web. ""I also later figured out that simply 'searching' a person's phone number (including country code) will show you their account.""  Prakash acknowledges that Facebook eventually blocked his script, but not before he was able to cultivate hundreds thousands of phone numbers. He also says he alerted Facebook about the vulnerability, but was ignored until his proof-of-concept started to receive media attention.","","US","1001 to 10000","519130","","","5.09e+09","USD","","","CA","Facebook",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-02-16T22:27:53Z","","N","","","654339BC-64C5-47D8-8071-0F14CB2350E1","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","11","10","2012"

They were all factors in a massive scheme to steal patient identities. The fallout led Miami's Jackson Health System to ban smartphones for all volunteers across the system, Report on Patient Privacy on AIS Health reported.  In March 2012, three men were found filing fake tax returns, using free WiFi in a McDonald's parking lot. One of the men, Loverson Gelmine, was a volunteer Jackson Memorial North's emergency department. Using his cell phone camera, Gelmine took approximately 1,100 photos of patient records that contained Social Security numbers and other health information, which he then sold to one of the other men. The scam landed him almost four years of prison time.  The ID theft ring reminds hospitals about the dangers of paper records, cell phones and volunteers.  Following the data breach, disclosed in November, Jackson Health tightened security and issued a system-wide policy that prohibited volunteers from using cell phones in patient areas.","","US","10001 to 25000","622110","","","6.17e+08","USD","","","FL","Jackson Health System",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","1100","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - law enforcement","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Patient","2013-02-21T06:02:40Z","","N","","","675F8789-FDC4-4B4D-B8C2-58B4C2EE41ED","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","11","1","2013"

An Anonymous China Twitter account was created late last month, was endorsed by the YourAnonNews Twitter account, which by the way has over 562,000 followers now, and the individuals behind it went to work. Boy have they been busy. Hundreds of Chinese government, company, and other general websites have been hacked and defaced in the span of a few days. A couple have also had their administrator accounts, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses posted publicly. On the hacked sites, the group even posted tips for how to circumvent the Great Firewall of China.  A long Pastebin post lists all the websites that were targeted. It contains 327 websites in total, but an updated list, also on Pastebin, brings that number to 485. Most of these websites are operational once again, but many have been defaced a second time after they were brought back. Not all of them were hacked and defaced; some were treated with more viciousness than others.

On Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher allowed Baltimore police officer Ashley Roane, 25, pre-trial release with conditions. She faces charges of attempted possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, aggravated identity theft and identity theft.  Federal prosecutors said Roane, who worked out of the Southwestern District, accepted illegal cash payments, protected a man she believed to be a drug dealer and accessed law enforcement databases to steal Social Security numbers as part of a tax scheme.  The man she assisted was working with Baltimore police investigators and FBI agents to build a criminal case against her. They began their investigation after the man, a confidential law enforcement source, approached investigators four months ago saying Roane had told him she could help him deal drugs in the area she patrolled, prosecutors said.  If convicted of all charges, federal prosecutors say she faces a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 17 years. Erica Hughes, Roane's 25-year-old roommate, was also charged in the alleged tax scheme.  As part of her pre-trial release, Gallagher imposed conditions that included around the clock electronic monitoring and in-home monitoring by a ""third-party custodian."" She warned Roane to have no contact with the federal prosecutors' confidential source.  As part of Gallagher's reasons for granting Roane release, she wrote in a court memo that Roane has no history of ties to criminals, has surrendered access to her service firearm, police uniform, vehicle and Baltimore Police computer system.  The judge also noted that Roane has no prior criminal or substance abuse history. Roane is required to report on a regular basis to a pretrial services officer, refrain from possessing a firearm or dangerous weapon. She also must submit to any testing, therapy or treatment required by pretrial services, ""obtain no passport"" and open no new lines of credit.  Hughes was also granted pretrial release without bail, according to federal court records. A judge also subjugated her to conditions that included house arrest and reporting to a Pretrial Services officer on a regular basis.","","US","1001 to 10000","922120","","","","","","","MD","Baltimore Police Department",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-08-25T21:47:39Z","","U","","","6AE50671-71FF-465E-ACC8-6D6077E054B6","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","5","6","2013"

Im guessing that IRS didnt expect to have to protect taxpayers from identity theft from its own employees. However, thats exactly what federal investigators allege happened in Philadelphia.

An IRS employee since 2007, Flowers allegedly used information gleaned from taxpayer returns to apply for credit cards in central Florida and eastern Pennsylvania. On at least one occasion, Flowers allegedly used official IRS letterhead and envelope to request more information from a victim, and threatened the victim with an IRS audit if he did not cooperate.","","US","50001 to 100000","921130","1","","","","","","","Internal Revenue Service",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"NA","","NA","NA","She might have accessed systems, but I'm assuming she stole info from paper doc returns.","Victim",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2011","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","whbaker","","U","","","Y","Customer","2013-10-25T15:02:00Z","","","657","","6AEEDDE9-CB91-4193-829A-6D73C586F535","2013-10-25T15:02:00Z","","","2012"

In a statement posted Jan. 3, Google announced that its Chrome browser ""detected and blocked an unauthorized digital certificate"" for its domain Dec. 24. The online services giant provided few details, but tracked the certificate back to a legitimate provider of digital encryption and certificate products, TurkTrust. Google updated its Chrome browser to revoke the two powerful certificates that had been mistakenly issued and the certificate created for its own domain.

After 37 years as a city employee, housing inspections director Tom Deegan was put on paid leave in September when prosecutors charged him with accessing driver's license records without a business purpose. The records, which contain photographs, addresses and driving histories of nearly every Minnesotan, are protected under state and federal law.  Misuse of driver and vehicle services (DVS) records is a common problem among public employees across Minnesota, according to state audits, but records show that it rarely leads to criminal prosecution. The city of St. Paul, which is prosecuting Deegan, simultaneously filed similar charges against Deegan's colleague Michael Karney this fall.  Deegan's position often required him to look up driver's license records, but prosecutors claim that at least some of his 3,370 queries over 5 1/2 years were unauthorized. They cite Deegan's frequent queries of his own file, in addition to those of his deceased family members, which could fall outside the law.  Deegan admits looking up his relatives' records, but denies looking up many of the names cited by an internal affairs investigator and says other employees used his password.","","US","1001 to 10000","92114","","","","","","","MN","Minneapolis City Hall",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","3370","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Int - IT audit","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-02-22T17:33:34Z","","N","","","749CE13F-FE0B-4FE6-A16A-72D56132F2CC","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","21","12","2012"

In order to avoid compounding the potential breach, we are not disclosing details at this time. While no patients were harmed as a result of this incident, we concluded that Jackson policies were, indeed, violated. Consistent with our culture of accountability, employees were terminated or otherwise disciplined. Appropriate reports were made to regulatory agencies. Rest assured that we hold patient privacy and quality of care as core values at all Jackson facilities.  Two managers, South’s chief nursing officer and the head of the obstetrics unit, resigned as a result of the breach.  Update: According to sources, the child was born on Oct. 4 and abandoned by its mother. A couple of days later the newborn was taken from the second-floor nursery to the first floor.  The hospital security band was taken off the baby, and a family looking to adopt was directly contacted by one of the employees and went to the hospital to see the baby, the sources told NBC 6 South Florida.","","US","Unknown","622110","","","","","","","FL","Jackson South Community Hospital",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","1","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","12","2012","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Patient","2013-06-05T21:45:45Z","","N","","","7897E025-A030-4AB8-B9BE-19D8C5A2177D","2013-12-06T19:26:49Z","11","12","2012"

Attorneys tell the San Mateo County Times (http://bit.ly/ZdKHGG) that 39-year-old Romeo Natan has credit for about 10 months in jail and will likely serve the rest of his sentence in a residential drug treatment program. He was sentenced on Tuesday.  Natan pleaded no contest in January to one felony count each of identity theft, fraud and burglary. Attorneys say he targeted credit cards and mail going through San Carlos to feed a methamphetamine habit.  A telegram from 1938 was among the thousands of pieces of mail Natan was caught with. A Daly City police detective helped get the telegram to its rightful owners.","","US","Over 100000","491110","","","","","","","CA","United States Post Office",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Transmitted unencrypted","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-08-23T23:25:49Z","","U","","","7ABD421E-3F49-4D2F-BCCD-3FBAD9E050EC","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","22","5","2013"

While Sina has already closed the security breach, Youxia pointed out that following user data leaks at online communities CSDN.net and Tianya, Sina claimed passwords were encrypted in their database, but the exploit has proven that the majority of passwords are saved in plain text.","","CN","1001 to 10000","519130","","","482830000","USD","","","","SINA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-02-12T03:05:58Z","","N","","","7DCE9AD1-2138-4DAA-BEDE-9FAF49B81B59","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","5","1","2012"

The Manawatu Standard revealed yesterday that Palmerston North woman Zelda McConachy was mailed other patients' mental health data after she applied to MidCentral to see her own files.  MidCentral has since launched a double investigation to determine the cause of both alleged privacy breaches.  The dental records breach came to light after a parent informed MidCentral that they had received a double-sided letter from the Child and Adolescent Oral Health service containing information about their own child on one side, and another child's details on the other.  The letters sent to parents confirm enrolment in the dental service and contain their names and addresses, children's names and national health index numbers.  All 133 letters were sent out with incorrect information, with half of the recipients receiving somebody else's details, and the other half receiving no information at all, MidCentral's director for patient safety and clinical effectiveness, Muriel Hancock said.  ""We have established we certainly did make an error,"" she said.  ""There was nothing else about their health or any other personal details [in the letters] but that is besides the point. It is wrong information.""

No financial information, social security numbers, or home addresses were on the drive and therefore are not at risk. Additionally, there is no indication that patient information stored on the missing USB drive has been adversely used or disclosed.

Pleasant, TX Daily Tribune. The hospital, Titus Regional Medical Center, reportedly discovered the unauthorized access in the course of an audit in November. The nurse admitted to looking at the records out of curiosity but insisted that no records had been further disclosed.  The hospital decided to notify 108 patients in a letter which warned them of a slight risk of identity theft. The hospital administrator indicated that the notices may not be required under HIPAA but were being sent out of an abundance of caution, and emphasized that there was no evidence any data was printed nor disclosed to any third parties. Although most records accessed did not contain social security numbers, affected patients were nevertheless advised to contact the three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.","","US","101 to 1000","622110","","","66580000","USD","","","TX","Titus Regional Medical Center",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","108","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2011","Int - IT audit","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Patient","2013-02-20T00:05:48Z","","N","","","81C7388E-0BD6-4B01-BB95-1E1E50357C1E","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","19","1","2012"

The hospital district did not name the employee, but the U.S. Department of Justice identified him as Jarvis Thomas, according to the report. Mr. Thomas is accused of selling patient information to Jackson Home Healthcare owner Valdie Jackson, who would allegedly disclose that information to others, according to the report.

The hospital says it is unlikely that the information found on the microfiche was used inappropriately because specialized equipment is needed to view the documents. However, Texas Health Fort Worth is informing patients whose records may have been involved. The hospital is providing call center support to all patients and offering contact information for credit protection services to eligible individuals.   The microfiche was limited to Texas Health Fort Worth patients who were seen from 1980 to 1990.    The potential exposure of information occurred when Shred-It did not destroy Texas Health Fort Worth’s microfiche as had been agreed to in the contract between both companies, the hospital says.    May 13, 2013, Texas Health Fort Worth says it learned that a portion of the microfiche it had provided to Shred-It had been discovered in a park two days earlier by a local resident who reported the incident to the Dallas Police Department. In addition, three sheets of microfiche were found during that general time frame in two other public areas. Texas Health Fort Worth says it recovered the microfiche and began a thorough investigation.   The records on the microfiche may have included patient names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, clinical information, health insurance information and, in some instances, Social Security numbers. Texas Health Fort Worth says it has no knowledge that any of the information included on the microfiche has been accessed or used inappropriately.   Shred-It has advised Texas Health Fort Worth that the microfiche remaining in its possession was destroyed, the hospital says.

Allen previously pleaded guilty to Theft of Government Funds and Johnson previously pleaded guilty to Aggravated Identity Theft.  United States District Judge R. Bryan Harwell of Florence, sentenced Allen to five months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release.  Johnson was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment and three years supervised release.  They were both ordered to pay $26,059.55 in restitution.  Evidence established that Johnson worked preparing tax returns and Allen worked as an office manager for EZ Loan and Tax Services in Dillon.  Johnson used personal information obtained from former clients of EZ Loan to file tax returns and obtain refunds electronically.  Upon receiving the refund, Johnson and Allen would apply a small refund as a credit for loan payments on existing EZ Loan customer's accounts, then issue a ""change check"" in someone else's name.  Allen would then recruit people to cash the new checks.  Allen recruited nine individuals who were paid between $20 and $200 to cash the checks.  The balances of approximately $30,000 received from the IRS was split between Johnson and Allen.

The marks the second time Stanford University has been breached in less than three months. In May, a hacker known as “Agent 47” penetrated the campus information technology infrastructure and stole names, email address, photos and other data for more than 1,400 users and then posted the compromised data online for others to see.  In a press release, Stanford stated that it wasn’t aware of any protected health information, personal financial information or Social Security numbers being compromised. The attack was similar to an attack on a range of companies and large organizations in the U.S. and is working with security consultants and law enforcement to determine its source and impact.  The university is asking everyone with a Stanford University Network ID to change their passwords as a precautionary measure, and it warned that the process may have to be repeated as it learns more about the breach.","","US","10001 to 25000","611310","","","","","","","CA","Stanford University",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Student","2013-08-25T22:04:04Z","","U","","","8E1D555C-59A5-4E93-A726-0721A4995F1F","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","25","7","2013"

As a result of the incident, customers are being advised to change their passwords.  “A few days ago, we discovered that the security of our internal network at our offices in Roubaix had been compromised. After internal investigations, it appeared that a hacker was able to obtain access to an email account of one of our system administrators,” OVH representatives stated.  “With this email access, they were able to gain access to the internal VPN of another employee. Then with this VPN access, they were able to compromise the access of one of the system administrators who handles the internal backoffice.”  The company believes the cybercriminals were after two things: their European customer database, and their installation server system in Canada.  The European customer database holds customer names, contact details, and encrypted passwords. Fortunately, the company doesn’t store any credit card information.","","FR","11 to 100","518210","","","","","","","","OVH",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Unknown","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-08-25T08:15:47Z","","U","","","8F4C4FB1-CEFF-4CD6-B840-3593FCC649FF","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","23","7","2013"

The problem, caused by a coding error, existed between 2010 and 2012, but only affected those who viewed their tax statement inlines and then downloaded and printed a copy of the pdf file. The coding error was detected on April 29 and remedied on May 4.  According to McKessons explanation of the problem, it does not sound like people would readily spot other employees embedded information, but ADP has offered those affected a free year of credit monitoring.  The San Francisco-based McKesson distributes pharmaceuticals at a wholesale level and provides health information technology, medical supplies, and care management tools. No patient information was involved in this breach, and McKesson does not indicate when it was first notified by ADP.

Ashrafi, now managing attorney of the defendant firm's Los Angeles office, stole the files from his former employer, Waters, Krause & Paul, according to the complaint.  Maher claims he was forced out of Weitz & Luxenberg as ""part of a Machiavellian plot"" after he discovered the files had been swiped from Waters, Krause & Paul.      Maher claims his employers tried to stop him from disclosing the alleged theft as part of his termination agreement.    ""On August 27 and again on August 29, 2011, plaintiff Maher discovered, on the Weitz & Luxenberg Los Angeles office T:/drive computer file, the contents of the Waters, Krause & Paul law firm computer files that seemed to be a wholesale copy of the entire and complete Waters, Krause & Paul confidential and/or proprietary asbestos legal practice,"" the complaint states. ""As emails, later discovered, bear out, these Waters, Krause & Paul files were uploaded from defendant Benno Ashrafi's personal external hard-drive to the Weitz & Luxenberg servers and computer network as hereinbefore described, with the knowledge and approval of Perry Weitz and Arthur M. Luxenberg.""      Maher claims the information included Waters, Krause & Paul databases, client files, settlement documents and confidential patient information, including medical records and Social Security numbers.      Maher claims that the data on the firm's network and servers was made available to more than 370 employees, so that ""a janitor, law clerk, secretary or any other personnel in the office could access this data, take this data for their own personal use and/or steal a copy of the data for themselves and then sell their services to yet another law firm who stood to gain from the misuse of the Waters, Krause & Paul clients.""

The reviews by these fake reviewers, not surprisingly, were done incorrectly, and were not up to the journal’s standards of quality.

At work for more than a decade, the viruses were detected a few days after Thanksgiving, when the college's data security monitoring service detected an unusual pattern of computer traffic, flagging trouble.   It appeared at first that the problem was contained in a single computer lab at Cloud Hall on the Phelan Avenue campus, one of a dozen City College sites around the city. David Hotchkiss, the chief technology officer, immediately shut the lab down and reported the problem to Chancellor Don Griffin, General Counsel Scott Dickey and Board of Trustees President John Rizzo.  But a closer look revealed a far more nefarious situation, which had been lurking within the college's electronic systems since 1999. For now, it's still going on. So far, no cases of identify theft have been linked to the breach.

According to VMI spokesman Stewart MacInnis, the error was compounded when the class president, not realizing there was more than one spreadsheet attached to the administration's email, forwarded the message to the 258 members of the senior class.  MacInnis said the administration had meant to email only a spreadsheet with the names and hometowns of potential graduates as the school's 2012 graduation approaches. The class president forwarded the email asking students to make sure they were listed and to double-check their information, MacInnis said.

These reports pertained to 438 patients and were intended for the American Board of Surgeons to maintain the provider's board certification. Unfortunately, the package containing the medical information never arrived at his home and the United States Postal Service was unable to locate the package. The data elements involved in the documents include patient names, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, diagnoses, descriptions and summaries of select procedures and operations performed by the provider between October 2007 and September 2011. Upon discovery, the 374 MDG immediately initiated an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the loss and identify those who were potentially impacted. To mitigate this incident and prevent future compromises of this nature, the 374 MDG is currently reviewing their policies and procedures to assist providers with the board certification process.

Osabuohien Odyssey Oronsaye, 34, is charged with 58 counts of filing false claims, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. He was arrested Friday in Tempe.  The indictment said Oronsaye, originally from Nigeria, prepared tax returns with the names and Social Security numbers of individuals whose personal information had been stolen. Authorities said Oronsaye would then fabricate federal tax returns using the information. He also submitted fradulent credit card orders using stolen credit card numbers, the indictment states.  The investigation began in February when Cochise College officials contacted Sierra Vista police about a flash drive found in a college computer. The storage device contained about 900 names and personal information. An investigation into who owned the device was conducted.  Sierra Vista police said Oronsaye purchased the names and information online and used them to file the tax returns. He then had thousands of dollars in fraudulent refunds placed on prepaid debit cards. The names were purchased for $1.50 per name from online scammers, the police department said.","","US","101 to 1000","611210","","","7660000","USD","","","AZ","Cochise College",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","It isn't clear these are actually related to the college or if he was just using college computers to do the fraud.","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Other","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Unknown","2013-02-15T16:39:55Z","","N","","","990F0B2B-2E92-469B-A732-090D5A35ABC6","2013-12-06T19:26:49Z","11","12","2012"

According to the Journal Star, the U.S. Attorney's Office recently filed a federal charge against the 22-year-old alleging he intentionally accessed protected information last spring before the system was breached on May 23. Documents such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, grades and financial aid information dated back to the spring semester of 1985.  The breach included information of about 650,000 students, alumni and applicants, however, once it was discovered by a technical staff member at the university last May, it was shut down within hours. Immediately after the breach was detected, university officials contacted the students whose bank account information was stored in the school system, according to the source.","","US","10001 to 25000","611310","","","1.4e+09","USD","","","NE","Nebraska State College System",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","650000","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"Unknown","","Hours","","Weeks","","Unknown","23","5","2012","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","Y","","U","","Student","2013-02-17T03:17:48Z","","N","","","99FBE58D-6A7D-4A27-9056-A7B817E569C6","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","15","8","2012"

The notice says that there was an erroneous setting in the vendors system and the system generated a number of zero balance or aged account balance statements relating to care provided at the hospital since 2001 and these bills were sometimes sent to wrong or outdated addresses.","The error involved a 3rd party system and was done by a third party, thus they are the vic. The hospital is the secondary victim.","US","Unknown","491110","1","","","","","","","Unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","Internal","Internal","","Victim",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","8000","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Ext - customer","","","","Unknown","First pass","whbaker","","U","","","","Patient","2013-10-24T14:29:00Z","","","581","","9C6E95A3-5655-40F0-A7A2-EDBDAF9165FA","2013-12-12T18:59:33Z","","10","2013"

Victoria Idowu, who has since lost her job, was handed the fine after pleading guilty to breaching the Data Protection Act by handing over the confidential information.  Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court heard that the 39-year-old was working for London Probation Trust when she handed over the details in January last year. Prosecution told the court that Idowu, from Stockwell, London, had contacted the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference  regarding the alleged abuser, concerned about mistaken identity.  She was sent an email on 5 January containing the victim’s full details, including her address, and that same morning sent a text message containing the information.  The next day the police officer was contacted by the alleged abuse victim in a “distressed state”, Miss Khan said, saying she had been made aware that her ex-partner had obtained her address.

Data breached is alleged to include names and addresses of witnesses, victims, surveillance files of Islamic terror suspects, patient claims against various NHS Trust, police intelligence files and more.  The Liverpool Echo has reported that a member of the public found an unencrypted memory stick which contained, amongst other things, information about the Rhys Jones murder in Croxteth – including the names and addresses of witnesses, together with details of victims in other highly publicised cases and further details of cases including the Liam Smith murder in Fazakerley and the Rachel Jones stabbing in Everton.  The finder also is reported to have found that the memory stick also contained private bank account details, claims made by patients against various NHS trusts, surveillance files of Islamic terror suspects from the London bombings in 2005 and information about terrorist training in Pakistan, and police intelligence relating to Operation Alarm and Operation Gingerbread.  A spokeswoman for Merseyside Police is reported to have said that the matter is being investigated, that the memory stick was recovered on the day of the theft, that the accompanying laptop was encrypted and that no sensitive details regarding the Rhys Jones murder have been compromised.","","GB","101 to 1000","922120","","","","","","","","Merseyside Police Department",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2009","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Other","2013-07-02T15:56:45Z","","N","","","9F46A2D6-51B9-4C54-A673-FF4E5BB45034","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","","","2009"

During that time, Adetiloye funded a lavish lifestyle by conducting, with others, a massive fraud scheme accomplished by executing tens of thousands of fraudulent acts against individual people, financial institutions, commercial data providers, merchants, commercial mailbox companies, and state agencies.  Adetiloye’s scheme involved tens of thousands of acts of illegal conduct throughout the United States, as well as in Canada and England. Adetiloye and his co-conspirators fraudulently obtained the personal identification information from commercial data providers, such as LexisNexis and ChoicePoint, and with that information assumed the identities of those unsuspecting people to open credit card and other bank accounts at U.S. Bank and twenty other banks across the United States.

The error was not discovered until April 17, 2013, because the information was placed on a section of the website that was not directly accessible through the website, but only through a search engine.

Federal prosecutors allege the conspirators used the lease agreements to identify individuals with Navy Federal accounts. The conspirators would then impersonate and assume the identity of those account holders over the phone or Internet to steal funds.  What’s more, the conspirators recruited individuals who had Navy Federal accounts to serve as “hosts” for fund transfers, authorities said.  The conspirators would steal money from the victim’s account, cash advances or loan proceeds from fraudulent loan applications and transfer those funds to a host account, according to court documents.  The hosts would agree to accept the cash transfers, withdraw the funds and hand over the money to conspirators.  “After obtaining such monies, the conspirators sometimes gave the host a portion of the money for assisting in the transaction,” the indictment states.","","US","1001 to 10000","522130","","","","","1","North Shore Garden Apartments","VA","Navy Federal Credit Union",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","20","","Stored","",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","1","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","Yes","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-08-21T22:54:45Z","","N","","","A77FDCCF-E6CB-4D64-A2E6-F191C938DB4D","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","15","8","2013"

Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona is a covered entity under HIPAA and ACTS is a business associate that also provides services in La Paz, Pinal, Greenlee, Graham and Cochise counties.  “Sometime between March the 18th and the 25th, someone broke into an employee’s home and stole a work laptop and external hard drive,” among other belongings, Alicia Aguirre, the general counsel for ACTS, told the Yuma Sun.  Though the laptop had recovery software (the drive didn’t), it appears as though neither were encrypted. The employee works from home and had permission to have the laptop there, but it seems as though there was oversight in allowing an unencrypted laptop with protected health information (PHI) into an employee’s home, regardless of permission to do so. And the fact that the data was extremely sensitive, as behavioral and mental health patients were affected, further complicates the breach.","","US","Unknown","624190","","","","","","","AZ","Arizona Counseling and Treatment Services (ACTS)",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","500","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","18","3","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","Y","","U","","Patient","2013-08-25T21:14:59Z","","U","","","AC05377E-9FCB-410C-976E-A8B3FB199C2A","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","17","4","2013"

What’s worse, prosecutors say, is that he used it tens of thousands of times to download reams of confidential documents.  The so-called “unauthorized access” came with a price. On Thursday, federal district court judge Gerald Bruce Lee sentenced Steele to four years in prison, authorities said.  The stiff penalty comes in the midst of a national discussion about computer access and cyber security, much of it centered on Edward Snowden, who, as a government contractor, was able to access and then leak to reporters classified information about National Security Agency surveillance. Steele’s case, court filings show, is a more garden-variety incident of a disgruntled ex-employee snooping around his old shop.  Steele, of Alexandria, was convicted in May of 12 felony counts and two misdemeanor counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer, court filings show. Prosecutors wrote in court filings that after he left a Reston-based company called Platinum Solutions in 2010, he used a “secret backdoor email account” to repeatedly access the company’s computer systems until September 2011.  Christopher Amolsch, Steele’s defense attorney, wrote in court filings that his client admitted to accessing Platinum’s computer systems after the company “through sheer oversight, had neglected to revoke his access after his departure.” But Amolsch argued that Steele did not gain any competitive advantage for his new company, noting that Platinum, which was acquired by Fairfax-based SRA International Inc., did not lose any contracts to Buchanan and Edwards because of Steele.","","US","101 to 1000","54151","","","","","","","VA","Platinum Solutions",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2010","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Other","2013-08-23T00:34:19Z","","U","","","AC5C6BCC-3C62-4C94-BD70-888019D91778","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","12","5","2013"

Intelligence agencies in the United States and Britain are among those who were warned by Swiss authorities that their data could have been put in jeopardy, said one of the sources, who asked for anonymity when discussing sensitive information.  Swiss authorities arrested the technician suspected in the data theft last summer amid signs he was acting suspiciously. He later was released from prison while a criminal investigation by the office of Switzerland's Federal Attorney General continues, according to two sources familiar with the case.  The suspect's name was not made public. Swiss authorities believe he intended to sell the stolen data to foreign officials or commercial buyers.  A European security source said investigators now believe the suspect became disgruntled because he felt he was being ignored and his advice on operating the data systems was not being taken seriously.","","CH","Unknown","9281","","","","","","","","NDB (Swiss Intelligence Agency)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Other","2013-02-22T16:57:21Z","","N","","","ACA22495-BD4C-4BE1-B779-BCF7DC3F5C08","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","","","2012"

There are around 1,800 records comprising mail.house.gov and senate.gov email addresses and clear text passphrases.  “For the purposes of being far too generous with you guys, we have removed some of the passwords and shuffled the order of the remaining ones,” the hackers wrote next to the data.  “These are all current, valid credentials but they are not in the original pairings. We reserve the right to spontaneously decide this restraint was unjustified,” they added.  The leaked email addresses are publicly available on several websites. However, the passwords don’t appear to be taken from older leaks.  On the other hand, it’s difficult to verify if the data was actually stolen from the systems of the US House of Representatives or the Senate.  A few hours ago, Anonymous hackers also published contact details of US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contractors, subcontractors and employees. FEMA has yet to confirm the attack.","","US","Large","921120","","","","","","","DC","United States Congress",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","1800","","Unknown","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Partner","2013-08-25T21:53:40Z","","U","","","AE0F975F-3853-420A-AA59-33CAFF7EC099","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","18","7","2013"

Belgacom said the attack only affected its own systems, and not those of customers, and said it has filed a complaint with the Belgian federal authorities about the incident.  The attack reportedly affected a few dozen machines on Belgacoms network, including some servers, and the companys CEO said in a press conference that he had no idea how long the malware had been present in the network. There are reports that the intrusion had been active for as long as two years by the time the Belgian company discovered it.

The number of patients affected hasn’t been determined, but patient information included name, date of birth, Social Security number, health insurance information, diagnoses, and progress notes on patients in the St. John Sports Medicine Program from Jan. 1, 2011 to July 31, 2012.

Court records show Troy police investigators arrested 28-year-old Jonathan Rofeal Collins on Monday, and charged him with 16 felony counts of identity theft.  Records show police charged Collins with taking the personal information from a computer at the Econo Lodge where he worked as a front desk clerk. The charges also allege Collins used the information to make multiple purchases online and over the phone in the names used to rent rooms at the hotel.  Records show the thefts and purchases started in October 2012 up to May of this year. Records also show the victims were from as many as seven different states from as far away as California to Michigan, Texas, Kentucky, Indiana, Florida and Alabama.  Records also show the purchases made through the identity thefts ranged from as little as $32.95 up to as many as 23 different transactions against one victim totaling $1,189.40.

As of Monday, MasterCard and CardSystems said that of the more than 40 million accounts exposed, information on only 68,000 Mastercard accounts, 100,000 Visa accounts and 30,000 accounts from other card brands are known to have been exported by the hackers. The data exported included names, card numbers and card security codes.  MasterCard and CardSystems have offered differing explanations of how the data breach was uncovered. MasterCard said its fraud monitoring system identified a series of fraudulent transactions in April. Then, with the help of a member bank, traced the problem to CardSystems Solutions.  CardSystems, meanwhile, said in a statement it identified a potential security incident on Sunday, May 22nd and notified the FBI the next day, and Visa and Mastercard after that.

The computer was password protected, but not encrypted. It was purchased by New York University, but used by VA staff not on the VA network. The employee believes that the computer was stolen and reported the missing computer to VA Police on May 20.  The computer contained memos for 23 Syracuse VA patients containing full name, full SSN and HIV Resistance status, results of the HIV Viral Load/Resistance exam. The memos were generated because the VA staff does not have access to the medical charts for patients to enter the information.

These events have been previously reported to both VA Police and local law enforcement (Uniform Offense Report attached). Additionally, staff at N. Florida/S.

The spreadsheet contained the name and Social Security number of a ~umberof employees, including approximately 4New Hampshire residents. The recipient ofthis e-mail then fo~wardedthe same e-mail and attachment to 6ther Xcel Energy managers as part of an employee training status update. Although all of these managers need'ed some of this information to perform their responsibilities, not ~llof the managers needed access to employee Social Security numbers.  The inbividual who made the initial mistake reported it immediately to Xeel Energy's information technology sec~rityteam.

(Coventry) has agreed to pay the United States $3 million in return for the agreement by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland not to prosecute Coventry criminally for any crimes arising from the unauthorized access by its employees to a Medicare database.   According to the agreement, from May 2005 to no later than December 29, 2006, some employees of Coventry and/or First Health Priority Services, a subsidiary, inappropriately accessed the Medicare database to obtain Medicare eligibility information for the sale of Medicare set-aside products. A Medicare set-aside is created from a process that allocates a portion of a worker’s compensation settlement to pay future medical expenses that would otherwise be payable by Medicare. Coventry’s actions were intended in part to give Coventry an unfair advantage over its competitors.     Several senior employees were aware of the unauthorized access to the Medicare database, including Coventry’s senior vice president for worker’s compensation services, senior vice president for government programs, senior vice president of service operations and the manager of Medicare enrollment department. All of these individuals have terminated their employment with Coventry.     In January 2007, the CMS contacted Coventry regarding the unauthorized access. Coventry acknowledged that employees had inappropriately accessed the database, and pledged to take corrective action.  In addition to the monetary settlement, Coventry has agreed to maintain new-hire and annual training for all of its employees who have been granted access to government databases, which include mandatory testing on fraud abuse, privacy and security.

The Mounted Police Professional Association of Canada filed a complaint today asking the federal privacy commissioner to investigate.  The association claims the information was disclosed to B.C.’s College of Psychologists without consent in order to bolster the force’s complaint against psychologist Michael Webster, an outspoken critic of the organization.  Association president Rae Banwarie says the disclosure shows a “crass and cynical disregard” for RCMP member’s privacy and most sensitive personal health information.  The RCMP filed the complaint against Webster last August, saying his advocacy for change within the organization was detrimental to the treatment of his police officer patients.  The college found that the complaint against Webster was unfounded.","","CA","11 to 100","813930","","","","","","","","Mounted Police Professional Association of Canada",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Partner","2013-08-23T00:44:33Z","","U","","","BABAA95E-B2F1-46B0-B392-DC2D2AE84E9A","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","30","7","2013"

According to Fox 4, Williams hacked into the high school’s secure Wi-Fi network – which stores test results, employee records, a master key list and building alarm codes – in March and April. In addition, he used school printers to print out the stolen security codes and test results.  Investigators traced the breach back to the student’s phone based on logs and an IP address. Surveillance videos showed that he was in the Wi-Fi area during the breaches.  Arrest documents reveal that Williams wanted to get back at the school after an English teacher refused to grade a report he wrote based on a trip to a gun show.  The teacher argued that the report came shortly after the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre.

Michael Sta. Maria, a security guard, found the device which he first thought was an improvised explosive device.  Sta. Maria quickly informed the authorities when he discovered the wired device set up at the number pad of the banks ATM machine.  Authorities led by Senior Inspector Robledo Zinampan, were deployed in the area and they carefully detached the device from the ATM machine.  The device, he said, is used for recording PIN numbers of ATM cards.  The Angeles City police requested for the review of the banks CCTV footage at the ATM machine to ascertain the identity of the perpetrators.  Police also advised executives of the bank to look if there are other devices installed at the card receiver of the ATM machine. The skimming device will be subjected to technical analysis, police said.","","PH","10001 to 25000","522110","","","","","","","","Metrobank",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","","","Unknown","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","8","2013","Int - security alarm","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","","U","","","","Customer","2013-09-10T04:35:00Z","","","","","BF6D0180-DF65-4534-8C5D-9A1BC935A367","2013-09-10T04:35:00Z","5","8","2013"

This is a seminal case both because of its egregious nature and the fact that it’s among the first criminal prosecutions in the nation for wrongful disclosure of patient information under HIPAA.  Helene Michel, the owner of Medical Solutions Management Inc. (MSM), a Hicksville, NY medical supply company, according to PHIPrivacy.net, was convicted of $10.7 million Medicare fraud and wrongful disclosure of private patient information in September. Michel was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison by United States District Judge Joseph F. Bianco at the federal courthouse in Central Islip, New York.  She used her position at MSM to enter from Long Island nursing homes (Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Kings, and Dutchess Counties) and steal patient data over a four-and-a-half-year period from April 2003 to March 2007. Michel then used that information to submit fake Medicare claims that her company never covered for patients.","","US","Unknown","62","","","","","","","NY","Medical Solutions Management, Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","1000","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2003","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Patient","2013-06-06T18:27:29Z","","N","","","BFC8B1F5-3CA7-4260-9B0A-D309F370462B","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","27","9","2012"

Lind, 49, was charged last month with 44 felony counts in connection with a check counterfeiting scheme, according to authorities who say he gleaned bank account information from shredded checks he plucked from a Valencia dumpster.  The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department launched an investigation after a Castaic church reported bank account information had been stolen and used to write counterfeit checks. Detectives discovered 20 different victims, all Santa Clarita Valley residents and businesses, who had one thing in common. They had written checks to Valencia Self Storage in Valencia.  When investigators searched Lind’s residence in Newhall last October, they found check printers, computers and “bags and boxes full of these shredded documents,” said sheriff’s Det. David Lingscheit.  Lind would allegedly take a bag of shreds, divide the contents into smaller boxes and then assemble the pieces, each about 2 inches long and a quarter-inch wide, on top of the box and piece together bank account and routing numbers.  He then used the information to print and write more than 30 counterfeit checks worth about $16,000, authorities said.","","US","1 to 10","531130","","","79000","USD","","","CA","Valencia Self Storage",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - law enforcement","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-02-13T06:01:52Z","","N","","","C07E499F-C3B9-4E72-A424-322D3EC9A299","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","","","2012"

That's according to a letter the Detroit-based hospital system sent to patients.  The Detroit Free Press reports Monday (http://on.freep.com/12cXv1F ) thieves may have taken the X-rays involving 15,417 patients because of the silver that's contained in them.  Henry Ford spokesman David Olejarz says the silver interacts with radiation to allow for a clearer image.  The stolen X-rays were dated between 1996 and 2003. The letter sent to patients says names, addresses and dates of birth may have been included on the X-rays, but health insurance numbers and social security numbers were not.  Henry Ford officials on May 24 learned of the theft from a warehouse that's owned and operated independent of the health system.","","US","Unknown","0","","","","","","","MI","Henry Ford Health System",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","15000","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Patient","2013-08-22T21:58:54Z","","U","","","C29C4C44-7BB4-4E06-AB72-6452F8A0AEC7","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","22","7","2013"

Besides Yahoo email addresses, the list also included email addresses for Gmail, Hotmail, AOL and other services. Users of the Yahoo Contributor Network can sign up using their Google or Facebook IDs, which accounts for the various emails listed.   The breach occurred courtesy of a group of hackers known as D33Ds Company, which posted a text file with the information online and said they used union-based SQL injection to swipe the information.  ""We hope that the parties responsible for managing the security of this subdomain will take this as a wake-up call, and not as a threat,"" D33Ds said in a message accompanying the leaked data.

A forensic analysis of the two computers from Public Works and Government Services Canada showed no malicious code or “suspicion of infection or compromise,” according to a security report filed after the incident, but IT security workers were working on the firewalls around the network to ensure another hacker didn’t gain unauthorized access.  The hacker was able to get into the computers through a program that allows remote access to a workstation via an Internet connection. The breach began May 31 and was still active on June 7 when the unnamed source told Shared Services Canada about suspicious network activity.  The “brute force” attack on Public Works was one of several successful breaches between May and August, according to reports released to Postmedia News under the access to information law that showed successful cyber-attacks targeted departments and agencies that were previously not breached, including the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, which was hit twice in July and once in August.","","CA","Unknown","561499","","","","","","","","Public Works and Government Services Canada",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","31","5","2012","Ext - unrelated party","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Unknown","2013-02-20T05:30:29Z","","N","","","C3CA451A-B82E-461C-8D7C-1FBACCC0DC4A","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","31","12","2012"

At least 18 students were involved.  The breach happened when students used software to imitate a legitimate software update on their computers.  The students then asked teachers to enter administrative account information so that they could complete the software updates or installations.  The phony software then stored teacher credentials.  The students were then able to control 300 laptops belonging to other students by using the administrative credentials.  The school believes that servers and sensitive information were not exposed.  The breach occurred around Friday, April 26 and was discovered on Monday, April 29 when students noticed that other students appeared to be controlling student laptops remotely and reported the issue.","","US","Unknown","611110","","","","","","","AK","Schoenbar Middle School",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","","","","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","","First pass","","","","","","","","2013-09-10T20:13:32Z","","","","","C4B41244-7B89-4829-B16F-A362CD791445","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","3","5","2013"

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that about 20 documents are feared to have been stolen, though none of them were confidential. The ministry said it was made aware of the breach on Jan. 28 by Japan's National Information Security Center, a government body. The incident was described in a public posting dated Tuesday.  The leak occurred on a government network that doesn't handle highly sensitive materials. The documents leaked were all rated at the country's second-highest security clearance or lower, which the ministry describes as documents that are not classified but ""could infringe the rights of the public or impede administrative affairs if leaked.""  The ministry said it immediately took measures to stop leaks to the server in question and is working with outside specialists to investigate the incident. It did not provide information on the external server, as investigations are still going on.  Japanese government computers have long been the target of hackers, with officials often claiming the attacks come from nearby China. The government and national police have in recent years scrambled to establish new agencies and publish user guidelines to make its networks safer.  Last year, Japan's space agency said a virus may have stolen sensitive information on a long-range rocket project, after a single employee's computer was compromised. In the previous year, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, said images and emails were leaked in a separate incident when a worker opened software sent in a targeted mail.  The country's agriculture ministry has also been hit with attacks, as has the Diet, the national parliament. Two years ago, both houses of Japan's parliament were hacked via ""Trojan Horse"" software opened by its members, possibly leaking names and passwords of politicians.

The Justice Department press release reports that the researcher, Huping Zhou, who admitted to illegally reading private and confidential medical records, mostly from celebrities and other high-profile patients, was sentenced to four months in federal prison. Zhou specifically admitted to knowingly obtaining individually identifiable health information without a valid reason, medical or otherwise. Zhou is the first person in the nation to be convicted and incarcerated for misdemeanor HIPAA offenses for merely accessing confidential records without a valid reason or authorization.

A group called ""Inj3ct0r Team"" who themselves host an exploit database has claimed responsibility for the attack. ExploitHub is obviously a high profile target as the ExploitHub market houses exploits and other products that Authors have submitted to market to Customers via the marketplace. While we do not allow 0day in the market, and all exploits in the market are for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, this product content is still of high value to both our Authors and our Customers.  After our initial investigation we have determined that the web application server itself was compromised and access to the database on that server was available to the attacker. The server was compromised through an accessible install script that was left on the system rather than being removed after installation, which was an embarrassing oversight on our part. The database on that server however only contains information used by the web application itself as well as product information such as exploit name, price, and Author, but does not contain any actual product data such as exploit code. The product data is stored elsewhere and there is currently no evidence that the storage location was accessed by any unauthorized party or that any of the exploit code or other product data has been compromised or stolen as has been claimed, however our investigation is ongoing.  The exploit information provided in Inj3ct0r's attack announcement text file and SQL dump consists of exploit names, prices, the dates they were submitted to the market, the Authors' IDs, and the Authors' usernames, all of which is publicly available information retrievable from the web application's normal browse and search functions; this is not private information and it was already publicly accessible by simply searching the product catalog through the website.","","US","Unknown","51919","","","","","","","TX","ExploitHub",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","The information included exploit names, prices and the names of researchers but not any actual exploit code, which could be used in attacks.","Unknown","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Other","2013-02-21T05:39:09Z","","N","","","D749F627-C539-4F82-A05D-9765174252FA","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","11","12","2012"

It is the first local authority in Scotland to be fined by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which is calling for stronger auditing powers to detect other breaches.  Midlothian has apologised and said staff have been subject to disciplinary proceedings, but insisted no-one was put at risk.  In one instance, on 1 June, child protection minutes were sent to the former home of a mother’s partner, who had lived there in a previous relationship.  “The commissioner understands that the former partner may have further disseminated this information to individuals in the wider local community,” the ICO report said.","This article contains 5 incidents.

According to American Banker, Citigroup has blamed “limitations” in the piece of software responsible for redacting the documents.  “As a result of this limitation in technology, personally identifiable information could be exposed and read if electronic versions of the court records were accessed and downloaded from the courts' online docket system and if the person downloading the information had the technical knowledge and software to restore the redacted information,” the company stated.  When the incident was discovered in April 2011, Citi took immediate steps to remediate the issue. However, the US Justice Department’s US Trustee Program was unhappy with the fact that Citi failed to disclose the full extent of the breach.  In addition, the bank also failed to come up with a solution to the problem, and it did not promise to notify customers.  In a pact with US Trustee unsealed last week, Citi promised to notify all the impacted parties, offer a year of free credit monitoring, and redact the sensitive information at its own expense.","","US","Over 100000","522110","","","","","","","NY","Citigroup Inc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","150000","","Unknown","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","Y","","U","","Customer","2013-08-23T23:21:23Z","","U","","","DB2BDD6F-DB1E-4A92-9DB1-5D517468679D","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","22","7","2013"

The theft occurred May 22, hospital officials said Friday, and the stolen laptop, which contained a tracking device, has not been recovered.  “There were no Social Security numbers, there were no complete medical records, and there were no medication lists” on the laptop, said Dr. John Halamka, Beth Israel Deaconess’s chief information officer. “There was also no financial data, and nothing that would be used from an identity theft perspective.”  Beth Israel Deaconess routinely protects information on company-issued computers by encrypting the material with software that makes it difficult to decipher, but in this case the stolen laptop was the physician’s personal device that was used for some office work.","","US","1001 to 10000","622110","","","575700000","USD","","","MA","Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","3900","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","22","5","2012","Int - reported by user","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Patient","2013-02-19T18:11:37Z","","N","","","DD8B6CD8-6481-40EF-9911-1983F284CE14","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","20","7","2012"

The hackers stole the data, deleted it from the hosting provider's systems, and then posted it on the Web.  UGNazi also gained access to WHMCS’s Twitter account, which it used to publicize a series of posts on Pastebin that contained links to locations from which the billing firm’s customer records and other sensitive data might be downloaded. A total of 500,000 records, including customer credit card details, were leaked as a result of the hack, according to news reports.  WHMCS developer Matt Pugh wrote in a blog: ""The person was able to impersonate myself with our Web hosting company, and provide correct answers to their verification questions. And thereby gain access to our client account with the host, and ultimately change the email and then request a mailing of the access details.  ""This means that there was no actual hacking of our server. They were ultimately given the access details. This is obviously a terrible situation, and very unfortunate, but rest assured that this was no issue or vulnerability with the WHMCS software itself.""  UGNazi compounded the problem by launching a large-scale distributed denial-of-service attack that froze WHMCS's Web servers.

They then attached keylogging hardware to the computers of four teachers, and harvested the passwords needed to access the central files of the school network.  They then used that access to change their grades slightly, nudging them up by increments so that all three got As.

The attack was launched from China's internet. After the incident, Auction.co.kr received a phone call offering to exchange the user information for money, the reports said.  According to a report on Dark Visitor, a security blog site, the Chinese hacker did not directly attack the server. The hacker sent out bulk emailings to the auction staff containing “hacker procedures"" that may have contained malware. When the staff members confirmed the emails, the hacker was able to gain their IDs. The hacker was then able to log into the Auction server using the staffer’s ID.  The WASC report categorizes the exploit as a cross-site request forgery attack. ""The attack description is vague, but can be best described as session hijacking,"" the organization said.

On Monday the 15th of October the Ministry of Social Development received a USB containing 7,307 items downloaded from two kiosks.  A team led by the Ministry’s Chief Legal Advisor then put in an intensive effort to analyse these items and categorise them based on the amount of personal information contained in them, and the sensitivity of that information. What did this team find?  Information on the USB related to corporate data. Most were invoices with no client details. However, as outlined above around 1,432 items did contain some personal information.  Of all these items, invoices relating to10 individuals contained highly sensitive information. Was there a privacy breach?  Yes, in the sense that two individuals accessed people’s information that was of a personal nature.  In the majority of cases, we have assessed the impact of the breach to be low as Keith Ng and Ira Bailey have assured us that the information was not further distributed and they have not retained copies.  In the cases of the eight children and two adults whose invoices contained highly sensitive information – we will be working on how best to respond to these individuals. This approach is in accordance with the Privacy Commissioner’s guidelines.","","NZ","Unknown","921120","","","","","","","","New Zealand Ministry of Social Development",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","7307","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","15","10","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Customer","2013-02-22T04:43:42Z","","N","","","E0338F1E-4936-4509-A968-64FF21B0CC6F","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","1","11","2012"

Both companies say they are investigating the incidents, but so far have found no evidence of a security breach.  Some LogMeIn users began complaining of receiving malware spam to LogMeIn-specific email addresses on Dec. 3, 2012. The messages matched spam campaigns that spoofed the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other organizations in a bid to trick recipients into opening a malicious attachment.  Multiple LogMeIn users reported receiving similar spam to addresses they had created specifically for their LogMeIn accounts and that had not been used for other purposes. The first LogMeIn user to report the suspicious activity said he received a malicious email made to look like it came from DocuSign but was sent to an address that was created exclusively for use with LogMeIn.","","US","101 to 1000","511210","","","119460000","USD","1","Docusign","MA","LogMeIn",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - customer","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","Yes","U","","U","","Customer","2013-02-16T23:18:01Z","","N","","","E0735263-146D-448A-ACD3-68BAA2759E0F","2013-12-06T19:26:49Z","12","12","2012"

The site is not government owned yet contains massive data, exposing login details of site users.  The hacker contacted me on Twitter and explained why the site was targeted, a similar explanation can be found on Pastebin where the data was dumped. The message can also read below:      The majority of the leaked accounts belong to Irani defacers.      The owner sucks for scanning his website with Acunetix to expose the vulnerabilities (This explains why there are emails like “acunetix123@acunetix.com”.

But Zappos said that no credit or debit card information had been accessed by attackers.  ""We were recently the victim of a cyberattack by a criminal who gained access to parts of our internal network and systems through one of our servers in Kentucky. We are cooperating with law enforcement to undergo an exhaustive investigation,"" said Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh in an email that was sent to all Zappos employees Sunday, shortly before the company sent an email to its customers, warning them about the breach.   The stolen data, said Hsieh, may have included each customer's name, email address, billing and shipping address, the last four digits of their credit card number, and a ""cryptographically scrambled"" version of their website password. Such encryption, however, might not prevent attackers from eventually recovering passwords. Likewise, any customers who reused their Zappos password on another website that had suffered a breach would be at risk from attackers using that password to access their Zappos account.

A press release from Illinois’ Attorney General Lisa Madigan on Friday alleged that Joseph Woods, 32, was the scheme’s ringleader. Woods paid employees to skim information from credit and debit cards used at restaurants around Greater Chicago. Woods gathered this information and later used it to make counterfeit credit cards which he, and an accomplice, Alex Houston, 22, allegedly used to make illegal purchases with.  Woods’ employees, Britain Woods, 33, Essence Houston, 28, Jenette Farrar, 34, and Kenyetta Davis, 31, all of Chicago, were also arraigned on Friday. The four defendants held jobs at 'The Friendly Confines' of Wrigley Field and Ralph Lauren Restaurant, along with local Taco Bell and McDonald’s restaurants. While working there, the employees swiped cards using a small reader given to them by Woods.  Bank accounts hit by the scheme include those with Chase, U.S. Bank, Citibank, Harris Bank, American Express, Bank of America and Fifth Third Bank. While the press release isn't exactly clear how many individuals were affected by the scam, a report from a local CBS affiliate, citing a statement from Assistant Attorney General Ansh Vaidya, claims a few dozen victims were affected from 2007 to 2011.","","US","Unknown","722511","","","","","3","Magnificent Mile’s RL Restaurant","IL","Wrigley Field",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2011","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","Yes","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-02-15T05:14:48Z","","N","","","E8A31DBA-7849-4BCB-9E19-55C8E83D08C1","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","27","4","2012"

Parsons, Amber Sasha-Rashawn Simmons and Joshua Clayton Thomas then used the data to file online fraudulent 2011 tax returns for 10 former Memorial Healthcare patients and did $818,000 worth of damage. While the patient names weren’t publicized, eerily enough, federal prosecutors did say that the data was stolen from both living and dead patients.

On March 15, Schnucks learned that a portion of their loyalty cards were affected, but waited until March 30 to send a press release.   Customer payment card numbers and expiration dates were exposed through a magnetic strip swiping security breach. No customer names were exposed.UPDATE (04/15/2013): The breach affected about 2.4 million customer debit and credit cards at 79 Schnucks locations.  Payment cardholders' contact and identifying information were not exposed.  Customers who visited a Schnucks between December of 2012 and March 29, 2013 may have been affected.UPDATE (05/24/2013): A class action lawsuit was filed against Schnuck Markets in early May.  Schnuck Markets claims that the the lawsuit belongs in federal court because of the case's scope and damages.  The lawsuit sought damages from Schnucks for time and effort that affected individuals had to put into monitoring and managing compromised credit card information.  The lawsuit also alleges Schnucks of willful and wanton neglect, a charge for which punitive damages are available under Illinois law.  However Schnucks states that the ""time and effort"" claims for Illinois alone easily exceed the $5 million threshold for federal consideration.UPDATE (06/21/2013): A new estimate from Schnucks states that 500,000 unique credit or debit cards may have been involved.UPDATE (07/11/2013): After a review, the Missouri Attorney General's office has stated that Schnuck Markets did not violate state data security law.","","US","10001 to 25000","445110","","","","","","","MO","Schnuck Markets Inc.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Yes","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","14","3","2013","Unknown","","","","Painful","First pass","","","","","","","","2013-09-10T20:13:32Z","","","","","EC5B111D-5F53-40CE-A2DD-14D647E86109","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","10","4","2013"

""We have been able to download the list of usernames and passwords that were posted and are currently running checks to determine its veracity,"" Foxtons said in an email to MyFoxtons users.  Although the list doesn't contain financial information like credit card details, access to a user's MyFoxtons account could allow a person access to their home address and phone number.  Additionally, a hacker could gain access to MyFoxtons' features that allow landlords to electronically sign documents, manage the payments of rents online and see the deposit registration numbers of their tenants, according to this online demo.  It is not currently known who is behind the reported breach, or how they may have gained access to the data.

Authorities say roughly 400 patients from Louisiana and beyond have to go through the process of reclaiming their lives.    Police arrested seven people for their parts in the identity theft ring, including Pamela Reams, who worked in the billing department. Detectives say she admitted stealing personal information from a hospital database to write counterfeit checks.  ""Late last week, LSU HCSD received from law enforcement copies of the check images printed by the employee and seized from her residence.

She was released pending sentencing.  Prosecutors say Rittall helped more than 20 people file claims under Maine’s Residents Property Tax and Rent Refund ‘‘Circuit Breaker’’ Program. She then used their personal information to file federal income tax returns claiming refunds in their names.  The Kennebec Journal (http://bit.ly/16TD6y9 ) reports that Rittall directed the refunds to be sent to bank accounts she had opened.

This latest, however, isn’t due to a lapse in the drugmaker’s systems, but can be traced to the company that provides cars to Pfizer employees, such as the sales reps. Last week, Wheels sent letters to about 1,800 Pfizer spouses and domestic partners saying there was a “temporary encryption error in the security system of a web site Wheels Inc was using to collect data.”  As a result, personal info was “briefly transmitted over the Internet in an unsecured manner.” What kind of info? Names, addresses, date of birth and driver’s license numbers. The info was to have been used for background checks in order for spouses or domestic partners of Pfizer employees to be eligible to drive the leased company car, Stratford Dick, Wheels’ marketing director told Pharmalot.  But he insists Wheels took “immediate steps to ensure that the data encryption was implemented appropriately.” There was no breach of Wheels website, he adds, and there’s no evidence to suggest that any of the unencrypted information was misused in any way. As a precautionary measure, the leasing company is offering two years of credit protection and credit restoration services free of charge. Whether that will please Pfizer employees remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Dick says a review of Wheelsâ€™ data-collection systems has been conducted to ensure that this situation doesn’t occur again.

The second round of data, leaked a few hours ago, consists of contact information for around 200 organizations, including law enforcement agencies and government contractors.  The information is not sensitive, but the hackers have told Vice that it’s just a small part of what they’re sitting on. More leaks will come, but only after the data is analyzed.  The hacktivists say they’ve had access to FEMA’s systems for quite some time, but they’ve stolen only small amounts of data at a time in order not to trigger intrusion detection systems.  As far as the timing is concerned, Anonymous says “an opportunity to settle an old score, an insult unanswered, arose.”  They’re targeting FEMA not just because of the cyber exercise in which it simulated an attack from Anonymous, but also because the organization is “an active investor in corrupt intelligence/defense/security contractors.”","","US","1001 to 10000","92219","","","","","","","DC","Federal Emergency Management Agency",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Partner","2013-08-23T04:56:03Z","","U","","","F482B24D-CBDB-4D91-8CE6-FF080298C2F6","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","17","7","2013"

Spyware was found on one of the agency’s personal computers on November 21. It was immediately disconnected from the local area network.  Experts are now probing into the origins of the virus, which could be a stray one or planted as a result of a hacker attack on JAXA. Among the leaked data JAXA cited the rocket’s parameters, specifics of its engine maintenance and protocols on agency’s meetings.  Japan started developing the next-generation solid propellant rocket, called Epsilon, two years ago. It is superior to the existing H-IIA rocket due to its smaller size, which will allow it to lift light satellites into orbit at a quarter of the H-IIA launch cost.","","JP","1001 to 10000","541720","","","2.63e+09","USD","","","","Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","Among the leaked data JAXA cited the rocket’s parameters, specifics of its engine maintenance and protocols on agency’s meetings.","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Other","2013-02-16T22:05:50Z","","N","","","F5DD40EA-7C06-4B43-8FC3-856121A8C6BA","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","30","11","2012"

The suspect, surnamed Zhang, 30 years old, earned 30,000 yuan ($4,727) selling the information while he worked as technical manager for a company that maintained the health bureau's database, according to Yu Song, vice captain of the Zhabei district police's economic crime department.  From the beginning of 2011 until April 2012, Zhang accessed the database twice a month from his home computer, downloading the information that then sold to a manager at Shanghai Roadway D&B Marketing Services Co, the Shanghai subsidiary of the US commercial information firm Dun & Bradstreet Corp.

Spokeswoman Laura Hart says the problem happened Dec. 24 when some of the 700 callers that day may have inadvertently been able to hear parts of other callers' conversations. It's possible personal information could have been disclosed, including Social Security numbers.  The department is investigating what happened. Hart says it shut down the phone system as soon as officials learned of the problem.  The department is alerting all callers from that day and offering them free credit monitoring services for three months.  Hart says it's believed the number of people affected is much less than the 700 who called that day.

The backdoor was contained in older versions of the Niagara AX Framework, which is used to remotely control boiler, heating, fire detection, and surveillance systems for the Pentagon, the FBI, the US Attorney's Office, and the Internal Revenue Service, among many others. The exploit gave hackers using multiple unauthorized US and international IP addresses access to a ""Graphical User Interface (GUI), which provided a floor plan layout of the office, with control fields and feedback for each office and shop area,"" according to the memo, which was issued in July. ""All areas of the office were clearly labeled with employee names or area names.""  An IT contractor for the unnamed business told FBI agents the ""Niagara control box was directly connected to the Internet with no interposing firewall,"" according to the memo, which was published Saturday by Public Intelligence. The website has an established track record of posting authentic government documents. Barbara Woodruff, a spokeswoman in the Newark, New Jersey division of the FBI, where the memo originated, said the document appeared to be authentic.  The unauthorized access began in February, a few weeks after someone using the Twitter handle @ntisec posted comments indicating hackers were targeting SCADA—or supervisory control and data acquisition—systems. One tweet included a list of Internet addresses, including one that was assigned to the heating system belonging to the New Jersey business. The hack came five months before security researchers Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle blew the whistle on serious vulnerabilities in the Niagara system, which is marketed by Tridium, a company with US offices located in Richmond, Virginia.","","US","Unknown","000","","","","","","","NJ","Unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","2","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Other","2013-02-15T16:34:01Z","","N","","","F88AA70C-07F5-4D12-B38C-456FC7979E66","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","13","12","2012"

Her sister, Yadira Moreno, 34, of Nogales, pleaded guilty toone count of conspiracy to defraud the government.      According to the plea agreement, between 2009 and 2011, Arredondo filed federal income-tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service that contained false refund claims totaling at least $186,561.  She did this, prosecutors said, by taking legitimate income-tax returns of her clients and inflating their wages, adding fake dependents and using false filing statuses to boost their tax returns – all without their knowledge. Then she’d pay the clients their legitimate refund after skimming off the inflated amount.

According to a news release from Nutmeg State Attorney General George Jepsen, the data breach involved ""unencrypted personal information and protected health information"" of about 9,000 patients, stored on a laptop used by an employee of Greenplum, an EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC) subsidiary.  The compromised data includes names, addresses, dates of birth, marital status, Social Security numbers, Medicaid and Medicare numbers and medical record numbers, as well as some diagnosis and treatment information.  Hartford Hospital discovered the laptop's theft in June. It has been reported to police and is under investigation, according to Jepsen's office.  The employee was working on a quality improvement project related to hospital readmissions. The compromised data include records of 2,097 Hartford Hospital patients and 7,461 patients of VNA Healthcare Inc., a Connecticut home hospice services operator.  San Mateo, Calif.-based Greenplum was acquired by EMC in 2010 and forms the foundation for the Hopkinton, Mass.-based data storage giant's big data division.","","US","1001 to 10000","622110","","","2.09e+09","USD","","","CT","Hartford Hospital",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","External","External","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Potentially","9558","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,1,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - customer","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","Y","","U","","Patient","2013-02-20T05:08:26Z","","N","","","FA30CC56-033F-448C-9162-CD9D8B2D640B","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","30","7","2012"

They later released a video, right before hacking the church’s website, in which they said:      “We will not allow you to corrupt the minds of America with your seeds of hatred. We will not allow you to inspire aggression to the social factions which you deem inferior. We will render you obsolete. We will destroy you. We are coming.”  And come they did. Using the Twitter accounts @YourAnonNews, @LulzExecutive, @Shm00pLOL, and others, they posted sensitive information about Westboro Baptist Church members. The information included social security numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and even the family tree (i.e. how the members are connected to each other).","","US","Unknown","813110","","","","","","","MA","Westboro Baptist Church",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2012","Ext - actor disclosure","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","U","","Partner","2013-02-21T23:38:12Z","","N","","","FAF0CF9D-173B-4FC8-8A5E-1277D2B473DB","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","16","12","2012"

Most do so professionally, safely, reliably. A very few abuse them, getting high or selling them for a profit, mostly opiates. And a tiny minority — a handful in the history of nursing — turn medicines into a murder weapon.  One such nurse was Charles Cullen, who is the subject of my book The Good Nurse. A former Navy electronics technician who used his technical acumen to enable his crimes and avoid detection, Cullen got away with medical murder in at least nine hospitals over the course of his 16-year career. (He was finally arrested in 2003; he’s currently serving life in Trenton Maximum Security Prison.)   Cullen was the master of a new machine that hospitals started using to track and distribute drugs, a computerized cabinet called a Pyxis MedStation. Manufactured by an Ohio company called Cardinal Health, the machine is essentially a metal drug cash register with a computer screen and keyboard affixed to the top.Cullen had realized that if he placed an order of the drug for his own patient, then quickly canceled it, the drug drawer popped open anyway. He could simply take what he wanted without recording it in the system. It was that easy.","","US","Unknown","622","","","","","","","NJ","Unknown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","Fraudulent medication orders in this case.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2003","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Patient","2013-06-04T23:24:24Z","","N","","","FB786B04-6005-4656-81E6-74FAD324B048","2013-12-06T17:29:01Z","","","2004"

This incident was a result of a failure in a caching service that interfaces with devices using Exchange ActiveSync, including most smart phones. The failure caused these devices to receive an error and continuously try to connect to our service. This resulted in a flood of traffic that our services did not handle properly, with the effect that some customers were unable to access their Outlook.com email and unable to share their SkyDrive files via email. In order to stabilize the overall email service, we temporarily blocked access via Exchange ActiveSync. This allowed us to restore access to Outlook.com via the web and restore the sharing features of SkyDrive. These parts of the service were fully stabilized within a few hours of the initial incident. A significant backlog of Exchange ActiveSync requests accumulated as we worked to stabilize access. To avoid another flood of traffic, we needed to restore access to Exchange ActiveSync slowly, which meant that some customers remained impacted for a longer period of time.","","US","50001 to 100000","511210","","","","","","","WA","Microsoft Corporation",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"External","Unknown","Internal","Internal","","Victim",0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Days","3","",0,0,1,0,0,0,"NA","","","","","","NA","14","8","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","whbaker","","U","","","","","2013-09-13T17:13:00Z","","","","","FCA43278-6D87-4ABF-A918-3FA416F7551C","2013-09-13T17:13:00Z","","8","2013"

Vahe Ruben Yerkanyan pleaded guilty to one count each of burglary, forging an access card and using personal information to obtain credit and was immediately sentenced to 270 days in custody and three years probation.  Yerkanyan was also ordered to pay a total of about $4,500 in restitution to six victims, according to the Riverside County District Attorney's Office. Under the plea deal, 13 other counts were dismissed.  When the man was busted on May 14, it was at a Palm Desert branch of  Chase where he ""was using stolen account information,"" according to police reports issued at the time.    Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. Steve DaSilva said that two days before the arrest was made, Yerkanyan went into a vestibule at the Chase branch at 78- 805 Highway 111 in La Quinta on three occasions, installing and removing a skimming device.  A security guard at the Palm Desert bank later alerted law enforcement that someone was trying to use stolen account information there, DaSilva said.","","US","Over 100000","522110","","","","","","","CA","Chase Bank",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","","","Stored","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","U","","Y","","Customer","2013-08-25T08:09:08Z","","U","","","FE3705BD-BC20-4E1D-A467-26BD2D2D5B85","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","22","7","2013"

This is the second attack this year that involved a breach of employee data.  While the agency said in its memo that no classified data was compromised or targeted, obtaining personally identifiable information is one way that computer hackers use to gain access to computer systems containing critical assets. A spokesperson for the DOE confirmed that it had sent the memo on Wednesday. Cyber attackers were able to access the information by hacking into a human resources system which included information such a payroll data, according to a person familiar with the matter.","","US","10001 to 25000","926130","","","","","","","DC","Department of Energy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes","14000","","Stored unencrypted","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","",0,0,0,0,0,0,"","","","","","","","","","2013","Unknown","","","","Unknown","First pass","swidup","No","Y","","U","","Partner","2013-08-21T23:40:19Z","","N","","","FE48CF43-48E0-48E5-9B6B-8A4E6CFF1E72","2013-12-06T17:29:00Z","15","8","2013"

We do not have any indication at this time that Emory Healthcare IT systems have been affected,” the statement reads.  The organization claims that its systems are hit by a large number of attack attempts each day.  “In recent months, a number of large organizations have reported attacks involving their information systems.
